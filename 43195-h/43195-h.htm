<p class="ac lg150">INTRODUCTION</p>

  <p><a name="sect1">§ 1</a>. The following pieces are selected, as being
  the most important, from among the very numerous ones which have been
  appended to Chaucer's works in various editions.</p>

  <p>I use the word 'appended' advisedly. It is not true that these works
  were all attributed to Chaucer in the black-letter editions. The Praise
  of Peace was marked as Gower's in Thynne's first edition of 1532. Another
  piece in that edition is attributed to Scogan. The Letter of Cupid is
  expressly dated 1402, though Chaucer died in 1400. The Flower of Curtesye
  contains the words 'Chaucer is dede'; and The Testament of Cresseid
  contains a remark which, in modern English, would run thus&mdash;'Who
  knows if all that Chaucer wrote is true?'</p>

  <p>Those who, through ignorance or negligence, regard Thynne's edition of
  Chaucer as containing 'Works attributed to Chaucer' make a great mistake;
  and even if the mistake be excused on the ground that it has been very
  generally and very frequently made, this does not lessen its magnitude.
  The title of Thynne's book is very instructive, and really runs
  thus:&mdash;'The Workes of Geffray Chaucer newly printed, with dyuers
  workes which were neuer in print before, &amp;c.' This is strictly and
  literally true; for it contains such works of Chaucer's as had previously
  been printed by Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and Julian Notary (see vol. i.
  p. 28), together with 'dyuers workes [<i>of various authors</i>] which
  were neuer in print before.' Which is the simple solution of the whole
  matter, as far as this edition is concerned. The same remarks apply to
  the second edition in 1542, and the third, printed about 1550. But Stowe,
  in 1561, altered the title so as to give it a new meaning. The title-page
  of his edition runs thus:&mdash;'The Woorkes of Geffrey Chaucer, newly
  printed with diuers <!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagex"></a>[x]</span>Addicions which were neuer in printe before.'
  Here the authorship of Chaucer was, <i>for the first time</i>,
  practically claimed for the whole of Thynne's volume. At the same time,
  Stowe did not really mean what he seems to say, for it was he who first
  added the words&mdash;'made by Ihon lidgate'&mdash;to the title of 'The
  Flower of Curtesie,' and who first assigned a title (ascribing the poem
  to <i>dan Ihon lidgat</i>) to the poem beginning 'Consider wel'; see no.
  40 (vol. i. p. 33).</p>

  <p><a name="sect2">§ 2</a>. It is clear that Thynne's intention was to
  print a collection of poems, including all he could find of Chaucer and
  anything else of a similar character that he could lay his hands on<a
  name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. In other words, the
  collection was, from the beginning, a collection of the Works of Chaucer
  <i>and other writers</i>; and this fact was in no way modified by the
  adoption by Stowe and Speght of misleading titles that actually assigned
  to Chaucer all the poems in the volume! See further, as to this subject,
  in the discussion of The Court of Love below.</p>

  <p>The number of pieces appended, at various times, to Chaucer's Works
  are so numerous that I have been obliged to restrict myself to giving a
  selection of them only.</p>

  <p>Of the non-Chaucerian pieces printed by Thynne in 1532, I have
  included all but three. The rejected pieces are those numbered 18, 21,
  and 22 in the list given at p. 32 of vol. i. They are all poor and
  uninteresting, but I add a few words of description.</p>

  <p>18. <i>A Praise of Women.</i> Noticed in vol. i. p. 37. Though
  decisively rejected by Tyrwhitt, and excluded from Moxon's reprint, it
  was revived (for no good reason) by Bell, and consequently appeared in
  the Aldine edition, which was founded on Bell's. It enumerates the merits
  of womankind, and condemns the slanders of men concerning them. We ought
  to worship all women out of reverence for the Queen of heaven, <!-- Page
  xi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"></a>[xi]</span>and we shall
  do well to pray to Our Lady to bring us to the heaven in which she and
  all good women will be found. Thynne is not the sole authority for this
  poem, as it occurs also (in a Scottish dress) in the Bannatyne MS., fol.
  275. The whole of this MS. (written in 1568) was printed for the
  Hunterian Club in 1873-9; see p. 799 of that edition.</p>

  <p>21. <i>The Lamentation of Mary Magdalen.</i> Noticed in vol. i. p. 37.
  This lugubrious piece was probably the wail of a nun, who had no book but
  a Vulgate version of the Bible, from which all her quotations are taken.
  It bears no resemblance to any work by Chaucer, nor to any of the pieces
  in the present volume. It consists of 102 seven-line stanzas. The metre
  resembles Lydgate's, but the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> is
  hardly ever used. Bell's text is not taken from Thynne, but from some
  later and inferior reprint of it. For this poem, Thynne's first edition
  is the sole authority.</p>

  <p>22. <i>The Remedy of Love.</i> Noticed in vol. i. p. 38. It appears
  that the 'remedy of love' is to be found in a consideration of the wicked
  ways of women. Twelve whole stanzas are taken up with a metrical
  translation of one of the chapters in the book of Proverbs. The author
  refers us to 'the fifth chapter,' but he is wrong. He means chapter vii,
  verses 6-27. He also quotes from Ecclesiasticus, ix. 9, and xxv. 25.</p>

  <p>Nos. 28, 29, 30 (vol. i. p. 32) are not found in Thynne, but were
  first printed by Stowe. I give them below, at p. 297. The first two
  stanzas are Lydgate's; and probably the third is his also. It is no great
  matter.</p>

  <p>No. 41 (vol. i. p. 33) was also first printed by Stowe. To save words,
  I have printed it below, at p. 450, from the original MS.</p>

  <p><a name="sect3">§ 3</a>. I now consider the non-Chaucerian pieces in
  Part II. of Stowe's Edition (see vol. i. p. 33). Of these, nos. 45, 50,
  56, and 59 are here reprinted.</p>

  <p>Nos. 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 were all taken by Stowe
  from MS. Trin. R. 3. 19. Perhaps they are sufficiently noticed in vol. i.
  p. 41, as they present few points of interest. However, I enumerate them,
  adding a few remarks.</p>

  <p>No. 46. <i>The Craft of Lovers.</i> In 23 seven-line stanzas; 161
  lines. Besides the copy in the Trin. MS., there are copies (almost
  duplicates) in MSS. Addit. 34360, fol. 73, back (p. 142), <!-- Page xii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii"></a>[xii]</span>and Harl.
  2251, fol. 53 (now called 52). Dated 1448 in the Trin. MS., but 1459 in
  the other two. The first line ought to run:&mdash;'To moralise, who list
  these ballets sewe'; but it is clear that some one added the words 'A
  similitude' in the margin, and that this remark was afterwards
  incorporated in the text. Hence the first line, in the latter MSS.,
  stands:&mdash;'To moralise a similitude who list these balettis sewe';
  which is more than enough for a line of five accents. After two
  introductory stanzas, the poem becomes a dialogue, in alternate stanzas,
  between a wooer, named <i>Cupido</i>, and a lass, named <i>Diana</i><a
  name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; the result of which is
  successful. This may be compared with La Belle Dame sans Merci, and with
  the Nut-brown Maid. The twenty-third stanza forms the author's
  <i>Conclusio</i>, which is followed by an Envoy in the Addit. MS., and in
  the Harl. MS. only. The same MSS. <i>seem</i> to superadd two more
  stanzas; but they really belong to another piece.</p>

  <p>No. 47. Taken by Stowe from MS. Trin. R. 3. 19, fol. 156, back. <i>A
  Balade.</i> In 4 seven-line stanzas; 28 lines. Begins&mdash;'Of their
  nature they greatly them delite'; i.e. Women are by nature hypocrites;
  they like kissing live images rather than shrines. So I advise young men
  to take warning: 'Beware alwaye, the blind eateth many [a] flye'; a line
  which is quoted from Lydgate's ballad printed at p. 295. The author then
  prays God to keep the fly out of his dish; and ends by congratulating
  himself on being anonymous, because women would else blame him.</p>

  <p>No. 48. <i>The Ten Commandments of Love</i>; from Trin. MS., fol. 109.
  Also in MS. Fairfax 16. Begins:&mdash;'Certes, ferre extendeth yet my
  reason.' In 14 stanzas of seven-lines; the last two form the Envoy. After
  two introductory stanzas, the author gives the ladies their ten
  commandments. They are, it appears, to exhibit Faith, Entencion,
  Discrecion, Patience, Secretnesse, Prudence, Perseverance, Pity, Measure
  [Moderation], and Mercy. In the Envoy, the author says, truly enough,
  that he is devoid of cunning, experience, manner of enditing, reason, and
  eloquence; and that he is 'a man unknown.'</p>

  <p>No. 49. <i>The Nine Ladies Worthy.</i> In 9 seven-line stanzas, one
  stanza for each lady. Begins: 'Profulgent in preciousnes, <!-- Page xiii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"></a>[xiii]</span>O Sinope the
  quene.' Only remarkable for the curious selection made. The Nine Ladies
  are: (1) Sinope, daughter of Marsepia, queen of the Amazons; see Orosius,
  Hist. i. 10; (2) Hippolyta, the Amazon, wife of Theseus; (3) Deipyle,
  daughter of Adrastus, wife of Tydeus; (4) Teuta, queen of the Illyrians;
  see note to C. T., F 1453 (vol. v. p. 398); (5) Penthesilea the Amazon,
  slain by Achilles before Troy; (6) queen Tomyris, who slew Cyrus in
  battle, <span class="sm">B.C.</span> 529; (7) Lampeto the Amazon, sister
  of Marsepia, and aunt of Sinope; (8) Semiramis of Babylon; (9) Menalippe
  or Melanippe, sister of Antiope, queen of the Amazons, taken captive by
  Hercules, according to Justinus, ii. 4. 23. Most of these queens are
  mentioned by Orosius, i. 10, ii. 1, ii. 4; see also Higden's
  Polychronicon, bk. ii. chapters 9, 21, 24, and bk. iii. c. 7. From the
  Trin. MS., fol. 113, back.</p>

  <p>[No. 50. <i>Virelai.</i> Printed below, at p. 448.]</p>

  <p>No. 51. <i>A Ballade.</i> Begins:&mdash;'In the season of Feuerere
  when it was full colde.' In 7 seven-line stanzas. In praise of the daisy.
  Very poor. From the Trin. MS., fol. 160.</p>

  <p>No. 52. <i>A Ballade.</i> Begins&mdash;'O Mercifull and o merciable.'
  In 12 seven-line stanzas. The Trin. MS. has 13 stanzas; but Stowe omitted
  the tenth, because it coincides with st. 19 of the Craft of Lovers. It is
  made up of scraps from other poems. Stanzas 1-4 form part of a poem on
  the fall of man, from Lydgate's <i>Court of Sapience</i> (see vol. i. p.
  57). In st. 8 occurs the assonance of <i>hote</i> (hot) and
  <i>stroke</i>; and in st. 9, that of <i>cureth</i> and <i>renueth</i>.
  From the Trin. MS., fol. 161.</p>

  <p>No. 53. <i>The Judgement of Paris.</i> In 4 seven-line stanzas; the
  first is allotted to Pallas, who tells Paris to take the apple, and give
  it to the fairest of the three goddesses. After this, he is addressed in
  succession by Juno, Venus, and Minerva (as she is now called). Then the
  poem ends. Trin. MS., fol. 161, back.</p>

  <p>No. 54. <i>A Balade pleasaunte.</i> Begins&mdash;'I haue a Ladie where
  so she bee.' In 7 seven-line stanzas. Meant to be facetious; e.g. 'Her
  skin is smothe as any oxes tong.' The author says that when he was
  fifteen years old, he saw the wedding of queen Jane; and that was so long
  ago that there cannot be many such alive. As Joan of Navarre was married
  to Henry IV in 1403, he was born in 1388, and would have been sixty-two
  in 1450. It is an imitation of Lydgate's poem entitled A Satirical <!--
  Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiv"></a>[xiv]</span>Description of his Lady; see Minor Poems,
  ed. Halliwell, p. 199. Trin. MS., fol. 205.</p>

  <p>No. 55. <i>Another Balade.</i> Begins&mdash;'O mossie Quince, hangyng
  by your stalke.' In 4 seven-line stanzas, of which Stowe omits the
  second. A scurrilous performance. Trin. MS., fol. 205, back.</p>

  <p>[No. 56. A Ballad by Lydgate; printed below, at p. 295.]</p>

  <p>No. 58 is a Balade in 9 seven-line stanzas, of no merit, on the theme
  of the impossibility of restoring a woman's chastity.</p>

  <p>No. 59. <i>The Court of Love.</i> Printed below, at p. 409.</p>

  <p>No. 60 is a genuine poem; and no. 61 is Lydgate's Story of Thebes. And
  here Stowe's performance ceases.</p>

  <p><a name="sect4">§ 4</a>. The subsequent additions made by Speght are
  discussed in vol. i. pp. 43-46. Of these, The Flower and the Leaf, Jack
  Upland, and Hoccleve's poem to Henry V, are here reprinted; and Chaucer's
  ABC is genuine. He also reprinted the Sayings at p. 450. The pieces not
  reprinted here are Chaucer's Dream and Eight Goodly Questions.</p>

  <p><i>Chaucer's Dream</i> is a false title, assigned to it by Speght; its
  proper name is <i>The Isle of Ladies</i>. Begins&mdash;'Whan Flora, the
  quene of pleasaunce.' The MS. at Longleat is said to have been written
  about 1550. A second MS. has been acquired by the British Museum, named
  MS. Addit. 10303; this is also in a hand of the sixteenth century, and
  presents frequent variations in the text. It is very accessible, in the
  texts by Moxon, Bell, and Morris; but how Tyrwhitt ever came to dream
  that it could be genuine, must remain a mystery. I originally hoped to
  include this poem in the present selection, but its inordinate length
  compelled me to abandon my intention. In a prologue of seventy lines, the
  author truthfully states, at l. 60, that he is 'a slepy<a name="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> writer.' There are many assonances, such
  as <i>undertakes</i>, <i>scapes</i> (337); <i>named</i>, <i>attained</i>
  (597); <i>tender</i>, <i>remember</i> (1115, 1415); <i>rome</i>,
  <i>towne</i> (1567). Note also such rimes as <i>destroied</i>,
  <i>conclude</i> (735); <i>queen</i>, <i>kneen</i>, pl. of <i>knee</i>
  (1779); <i>nine</i>, <i>greene</i> (1861); <i>vertuous</i>, <i>use</i>
  (1889). Some rimes exhibit the Northern dialect; as <i>paines</i>,
  <i>straines</i>, pr. s., 909; <i>wawe</i>, <i>overthrawe</i>, pp., 1153;
  <i>servand</i>, <i>livand</i>, pres. pt., 1629; <i>greene</i>,
  <i>eene</i> (pl. of <i>e</i>, eye), 1719; <i>hand</i>, <i>avisand</i>,
  pres. pt., 1883; &amp;c. Yet the writer is not particular; if he wants a
  rime to <i>wroth</i>, he uses the Southern form <!-- Page xv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv"></a>[xv]</span><i>goth</i>, 785; but if
  he wants a rime to <i>rose</i>, he uses the Northern form <i>gose</i>
  (goes), 1287, 1523. But before any critic can associate this poem with
  Chaucer, he has first to prove that it was written before 1450. Moreover,
  it belongs to the cycle of metrical romances, being connected (as
  Tyrwhitt says) with the <i>Eliduc</i> of Marie de France; and, perhaps,
  with her <i>Lanval</i>.</p>

  <p>To the <i>Isle of Ladies</i> Speght appended two other poems, of which
  the former contains a single stanza of 6 lines, and the latter is a
  ballad in 3 seven-line stanzas.</p>

  <p>No. 66. <i>Eight Goodly Questions</i>; in Bell's Chaucer, iv. 421. In
  9 seven-line stanzas. First printed in 1542. There are at least two
  manuscript copies; one in the Trinity MS., marked R. 3. 15; and another
  in the Bannatyne MS., printed at p. 123 of the print of the Bannatyne
  MS., issued by the Hunterian Club in 1873. In l. 19, the latter MS.
  corrects <i>tree</i> to <i>coffour</i>, the Scottish form of
  <i>cofre</i>. It is merely expanded from the first seven lines of a poem
  by Ausonius, printed in Walker's <i>Corpus Poetarum Latinorum</i>, with
  the title Eorundem Septem Sapientum Sententiae. This English version is
  quite in Lydgate's style.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect5">§ 5</a>. <span class="sc">Editions and MSS. consulted</span>.</p>

  <p>I have repeatedly explained that there were but four black-letter
  editions of Collected Works before Speght's; and these I call Thynne's
  first edition (1532), Thynne's second edition (1542), the undated edition
  (about 1550, which I call 1550 for brevity), and Stowe's edition (1561)
  respectively. I shall denote these editions below by the symbols 'Th.,'
  ed. 1542, ed. 1550, and 'S.' respectively. Of these editions, the first
  is the best; the second is derived from the first; the third is derived
  from the second; and the fourth from the third<a name="NtA_4"

  <p>Of this piece no MS. copy has been discovered. The only authority is
  Thynne's edition of 1532, whence all later editions have been copied more
  or less incorrectly. The reprints will be found to grow steadily worse,
  so that the first edition is the only one worth consulting.</p>

  <p>The present edition is printed from a transcript of Thynne (1532),
  made by myself; the proof-sheets being carefully read with the original.
  In making the transcript, I have altered the symbol <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>,
  when used as a consonant; and (in the few places where it occurs) the
  consonantal <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>. I have also substituted <i>i</i> for
  <i>y</i> when the vowel is short, chiefly in the case of the suffix
  <i><span class="nw">-yng</span></i> or <i><span
  class="nw">-ynge</span></i>, here printed <i><span
  class="nw">-ing</span></i> or <i><span class="nw">-inge</span></i>. In
  nearly all other cases, the original spellings are given in the
  footnotes. Thynne's chief errors of printing occur in places where he has
  persistently altered the spelling of the MS. to suit the spelling in
  fashion in the days of Henry VIII. His chief alterations are as follows.
  He prints <i>ea</i> for open <i>ee</i>, written <i>ee</i> or <i>e</i> at
  the beginning of the fifteenth century; thus, he has <i>ease</i> for
  <i>ese</i>, and <i>please</i> for <i>plese</i>. He most perversely adds a
  useless final <i>e</i> to the words <i>howe</i>, <i>nowe</i>, and some
  others; and he commits the anachronism of printing <i>father</i>,
  <i>mother</i>, <i>together</i>, <i>wether</i>, <i>gather</i>, in place of
  <i>fader</i>, <i>moder</i>, <i>togeder</i>, <i>weder</i>, <i>gader</i>;
  whereas the termination in these words invariably appears as <i><span
  class="nw">-der</span></i> till shortly before 1500. Further, he prints
  <i>catche</i> for <i>cacche</i>, <i>perfection</i> for <i>perfeccion</i>,
  and the like; and in several other <!-- Page xix --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix"></a>[xix]</span>ways has much impaired
  the spelling of his original. Many of these things I have attempted to
  set right; and the scholar who compares the text with the footnotes will
  easily see why each alteration has been made, if he happens to be at all
  conversant with MSS. written in the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>I believe that this piece is almost unparalleled as regards the
  shameful corruption of its text. It cannot be supposed that Thynne or any
  one else ever read it over with the view of seeing whether the result
  presented any sense. Originally written in an obscure style, every form
  of carelessness seems to have been employed in order to render it more
  obscure than before. In a great number of places, it is easy to restore
  the sense by the insertion of such necessary words as <i>of</i>, or
  <i>but</i>, or <i>by</i>. In other places, non-existent words can be
  replaced by real ones; or some correction can be made that is more or
  less obvious. I have marked all inserted words by placing them within
  square brackets, as, e.g., <i>am</i> in l. 46 on p. 6. Corrections of
  readings are marked by the use of a dagger (&dagger;); thus 'I
  &dagger;wot wel' in l. 78 on p. 7 is my emendation of Thynne's phrase 'I
  wol wel,' which is duly recorded in the footnote. But some sentences
  remain in which the sense is not obvious; and one is almost tempted to
  think that the author did not clearly know what he intended to say. That
  he was remarkable for a high degree of inaccuracy will appear
  presently.</p>

  <p>A strange misprint occurs in Book III. ch. 4, ll. 30, 31 (p. 117),
  where nearly two whole lines occur twice over; but the worst confusion is
  due to an extraordinary dislocation of the text in Book III. (c. iv. l.
  56&mdash;c. ix. l. 46), as recently discovered by the sagacity of Mr. H.
  Bradley, and explained more fully below.</p>

  <p>I have also, for the first time, revised the punctuation, which in
  Thynne is only denoted by frequent sloping strokes and full stops, which
  are not always inserted in the right places. And I have broken up the
  chapters into convenient paragraphs.</p>

  <p><a name="sect8">§ 8</a>. A very curious point about this piece is the
  fact which I was the first to observe, viz. that the initial letters of
  the various chapters were certainly intended to form an acrostic.
  Unfortunately, Thynne did not perceive this design, and has certainly
  begun some of the chapters either with the wrong letter or at a wrong
  place. The sense shews that the first letter of Book I. ch. viii. should
  be E, not O (see the note); and, with this <!-- Page xx --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx"></a>[xx]</span>correction, the initial
  letters of the First Book yield the words&mdash;<span
  class="sm">MARGARETE OF</span>.</p>

  <p>In Book II, Thynne begins Chapters XI and XII at wrong places, viz.
  with the word 'Certayn' (p. <a href="#page86">86</a>, l. 133), and the
  word 'Trewly' (p. <a href="#page89">89</a>, l. 82). He thus produces the
  words&mdash;<span class="sm">VIRTW HAVE MCTRCI</span>. It is obvious that
  the last word ought to be <span class="sm">MERCI</span>, which can be
  obtained by beginning Chapter XI with the word 'Every,' which suits the
  sense quite as well.</p>

  <p>For the chapters of Book III, we are again dependent on Thynne. If we
  accept his arrangement as it stands, the letters yielded are&mdash;<span
  class="sm">ON THSKNVI</span>; and the three books combined give us the
  sentence:&mdash;<span class="sm">MARGARETE OF VIRTW, HAVE MERCI ON
  THSKNVI</span>. Here 'Margarete of virtw' means 'Margaret endued with
  divine virtue'; and the author appeals either to the Grace of God, or to
  the Church. The last word ought to give us the author's name; but in that
  case the letters require rearrangement before the riddle can be read with
  certainty.</p>

  <p>After advancing so far towards the solution of the mystery, I was here
  landed in a difficulty which I was unable to solve. But Mr. H. Bradley,
  by a happy inspiration, hit upon the idea that the text might have
  suffered dislocation; and was soon in a position to prove that no less
  than six leaves of the MS. must have been out of place, to the great
  detriment of the sense and confusion of the argument. He very happily
  restored the right order, and most obligingly communicated to me the
  result. I at once cancelled the latter part of the treatise (from p. <a
  href="#page113">113</a> to the end), and reprinted this portion in the
  right order, according to the sense. With this correction, the unmeaning
  <span class="sm">THSKNVI</span> is resolved into the two words <span
  class="sm">THIN USK</span>, i.e. 'thine Usk'; a result the more
  remarkable because Mr. Bradley had <i>previously</i> hit upon Usk as
  being the probable author. For the autobiographical details exactly
  coincide, in every particular, with all that is known of the career of
  Thomas Usk, according to Walsingham, the Rolls of Parliament, and the
  continuation of Higden's Polychronicon by John Malverne (ed. Lumby, vol.
  ix. pp. 45-6, 134, 150, 169); cf. Lingard, ed. 1874, iii. 163-7.</p>

  <p>The date of the composition of this piece can now be determined
  without much error. Usk was executed on March 4, 1388, and we find him
  referring to past events that happened towards the end of 1384 or later.
  The most likely date is about 1387. <!-- Page xxi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi"></a>[xxi]</span>I here append an exact
  account of the order of the text <i>as it appears in Thynne</i>; every
  break in the text being denoted, in the present volume, by a dark
  asterisk.</p>

  <p>Thynne's text is in a correct order from p. <a href="#page1">1</a> to
  p. <a href="#page118">118</a>, l. 56:&mdash;any mouable tyme there (Th.

  <p>(2) Next, in Thynne, the passage beginning at p. <a
  href="#page131">131</a>, l. 97:&mdash;ne ought to loke thynges with
  resonnyng&mdash;and ending at p. <a href="#page132">132</a>, l. 161, at
  the end of a chapter (Th. fol. 356, back, col. 2, last line).</p>

  <p>(3) Next, in Thynne, the passage beginning at p. <a
  href="#page124">124</a>, l. 8:&mdash;Now trewly, lady&mdash;and ending at

  97:&mdash;vse ye (Th. fol. 360, back, col. 2, l. 9).</p>

  <p>(7) Lastly, the text reverts to the true order, at p. <a
  href="#page143">143</a>, l. 46, with the words:&mdash;greatest wisdom
  (Th. fol. 360, back, col. 2, l. 9. as before). See The Athenæum, no.
  3615, Feb. 6, 1897.</p>

  <p>It is not difficult to account for this somewhat confusing
  dislocation. It is clear that the original MS. was written on quires of
  the usual size, containing 8 folios apiece. The first 10 quires, which we
  may call <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>,
  <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>k</i>, were in the right order. The
  rest of the MS. occupied quire <i>l</i> (of 8 folios), and quire <i>m</i>
  (of only 2); the last page being blank. The seventh folio of <i>l</i> was
  torn up the back, so that the two leaves parted company; and the same
  happened to both the folios in quire <i>m</i>, leaving six leaves loose.
  What then happened was this:&mdash;first of all, folios
  <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>&mdash;<i>l</i><sub>4</sub>, were reversed and turned
  inside out; then <!-- Page xxii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxii"></a>[xxii]</span>came the former halves of
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, and the latter half of
  <i>l</i><sub>7</sub>; next <i>l</i><sub>5</sub> and <i>l</i><sub>6</sub>
  (undetached), with the former half of <i>l</i><sub>7</sub> thrust in the
  middle; so that the order in this extraordinary quire was as follows:
  <i>l</i><sub>4</sub>, <i>l</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>,
  <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>, all inside out, half of <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, half
  of <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, the latter half of <i>l</i><sub>7</sub>,
  <i>l</i><sub>5</sub>, <i>l</i><sub>6</sub>, and the former half of
  <i>l</i><sub>7</sub>, followed by the six undetached leaves. The last
  quire simply consisted of <i>l</i><sub>8</sub> (entire), followed by the
  latter halves of <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, which
  were kept in the right order by the fact that the last page was
  blank.</p>

  <p>It has thus become possible for us to make some progress towards the
  right understanding of the work, which has hitherto been much
  misunderstood. Warton (Hist. E. Poetry, 1840, ii. 218) dismisses it in
  two lines:&mdash;'It is a lover's parody of Boethius's book De
  Consolatione mentioned above'; whereas the author was not a lover at all,
  except in a spiritual sense. Even the fuller account in Morley's English
  Writers (1890), v. 261, is not wholly correct. The statement is there
  made, that 'it professes to be written, and probably was written, by a
  prisoner in danger of his life'; but the prison<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> may have been <i>at first</i>
  metaphorical, as he could hardly have written the whole work in two or
  three months. In Book iii. ch. 9, ll. 131, 132, he prays that 'God's
  hand, which has scourged him in mercy, may hereafter mercifully keep and
  defend him in good plight.' The whole tone of the treatise shews that he
  is writing to justify himself, and thinks that he has succeeded. But a
  stern doom was close at hand.</p>

  <p><a name="sect9">§ 9</a>. The truth is that the attempts of Godwin and
  others to make the autobiographical statements of the author fit into the
  life of Chaucer, have quite led the critics out of the right track. That
  the author was <i>not</i> Chaucer is perfectly obvious to every one who
  reads the passage in the lower half of p. <a href="#page140">140</a> with
  moderate attention; for the author there refers to Chaucer as Love's
  'noble philosophical poet in English,' who wrote a treatise of Love's
  servant Troilus, and who 'passeth all other makers in wit and in good
  reason of sentence'; praise which, however true it may be of Chaucer, the
  writer was certainly not entitled to claim for himself. The sole point in
  which the circumstances of the author agree with those of Chaucer is
  this&mdash;that they were both born in London; which is, obviously, too
  slight a coincidence to build <!-- Page xxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>upon. Now that we know the author's
  name to have been Thomas Usk, the matter assumes quite another
  complexion. Usk was much inclined, in his early days, to a belief in
  Lollard opinions; but when he found that persistence in such belief was
  likely to lead to trouble and danger, he deemed it prudent to recant as
  completely as he could<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>,
  and contemplates his consequent security with some complacency.</p>

  <p>In just the same way, it appears that he had changed sides in
  politics. We first find him in the position of confidential clerk to John
  of Northampton, mayor of London in 1381-2 and 1382-3. In July, 1384, Usk
  was arrested and imprisoned in order to induce him to reveal certain
  secrets implicating Northampton. This he consented to do, and accused
  Northampton before the king at Reading, on the 18th of August.
  Northampton strenuously denied the charges against him, but was condemned
  as guilty, and sent to Corfe castle<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. After this, Usk joined the party of Sir
  Nicholas Brembre, mayor of London in 1383-4, 1384-5, and 1385-6, and
  Collector of Customs in 1381-3, when Chaucer was Comptroller of the same.
  Brembre had been active in procuring the condemnation of Northampton, and
  was, at the close of 1386, one of the few personal adherents who remained
  faithful to the king. In 1387, Richard was busily devising means for the
  overthrow of the duke of Gloucester's regency, Brembre and Usk being on
  the king's side; but his attempts were unsuccessful, and, in November of
  the same year, the duke of Gloucester and his partisans, who were called
  the 'appellants,' became masters of the situation; they accused the
  king's councillors of treason, and imprisoned or banished their
  opponents. On Feb. 3, 1388, the appellants produced their charges against
  their victims, Brembre and Usk being among the number. Both were
  condemned and executed, Brembre on Feb. 20, and Usk on the 4th of March.
  Usk's offence was that he had been appointed sub-sheriff of Middlesex by
  Brembre's influence<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, with
  a view to the arrest of the duke of Gloucester and others of his party.
  His defence was that all that he had done was by the king's orders, a
  defence on which he doubtless relied. Unfortunately for him, it was <!--
  Page xxiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>an
  aggravation of his crime. It was declared that he ought to have known
  that the king was not at the time his own master, but was acting
  according to the counsel of false advisers; and this sealed his fate. He
  was sentenced to be drawn, hung, and beheaded, and that his head should
  be set up over Newgate. The sentence was barbarously carried out; he was
  hung but immediately cut down, and clumsily beheaded by nearly thirty
  strokes of a sword. 'Post triginta mucronis ictus fere decapitatus semper
  usque ad mortem nunquam fatebatur se deliquisse contra Johannem
  Northampton, sed erant omnia vera quae de eo praedicaverat coram rege in
  quodam consilio habito apud Radyngum anno elapso.'&mdash;Higden, App.
  169. John of Malverne speaks as if he had some personal recollection of
  Usk, of whom he says&mdash;'Satagebat namque astu et arte illorum
  amicitiam sibi attrahere quos procul dubio ante capitales hostes sibi
  fuisse cognovit,'&mdash;Ib. p. 45.</p>

  <p>We can now readily understand that Usk's praise of Chaucer must have
  been more embarrassing than acceptable; and perhaps it was not altogether
  without design that the poet, in his House of Fame, took occasion to let
  the world know how he devoted his leisure time to other than political
  subjects.</p>

  <p><a name="sect10">§ 10</a>. Some of the events of his life are alluded
  to by Usk in the present treatise. He justifies his betrayal of
  Northampton (p. <a href="#page26">26</a>, ll. 53-103, p. <a
  href="#page28">28</a>, ll. 116-201), and is grateful for the king's
  pardon (p. <a href="#page60">60</a>, ll. 120-4). He refers to his first
  imprisonment (p. <a href="#page60">60</a>, l. 104), and tells us that he
  offered wager of battle against all who disputed his statements (p. <a
  href="#page60">60</a>, l, 116; p. <a href="#page31">31</a>, l. 10); but
  no one accepted the wager.</p>

  <p>He further tells us how he endeavoured to make his peace with the
  Church. Taking his cue from the parable of the merchantman seeking goodly
  pearls (p. <a href="#page16">16</a>, l. 84), he likens the visible Church
  of Christ to the pearl of great price (p. <a href="#page145">145</a>, l.
  103; p. <a href="#page94">94</a>, l. 121), and piteously implores her
  mercy (p. <a href="#page8">8</a>, l. 135); and the whole tone of the
  piece shews his confidence that he is reasonably safe (p. <a
  href="#page144">144</a>, l. 120). He sees clearly that lollardy is
  unacceptable, and indulges in the usual spiteful fling against the cockle
  (<i>lolia</i>) which the Lollards were reproached with sowing (p. <a
  href="#page48">48</a>, l. 93). He had once been a heretic (p. <a
  href="#page99">99</a>, l. 29), and in danger of 'never returning' to the
  true Church (p. <a href="#page99">99</a>, l. 38); but he secured his
  safety by a full submission (p. <a href="#page105">105</a>, l. 133). <!--
  Page xxv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxv"></a>[xxv]</span></p>

  <p>At the same time, there is much about the piece that is vague, shifty,
  and unsatisfactory. He is too full of excuses, and too plausible; in a
  word, too selfish. Hence he has no real message for others, but only
  wishes to display his skill, which he does by help of the most barefaced
  and deliberate plagiarism. It was not from the Consolatio Philosophiae of
  Boethius, but from the English translation of that work by Chaucer, that
  he really drew his materials; and he often takes occasion to lift lines
  or ideas from the poem of Troilus whenever he can find any that come in
  handy. In one place he turns a long passage from the House of Fame into
  very inferior prose. There are one or two passages that remind us of the
  Legend of Good Women (i. pr. 100, ii. 3. 38, iii. 7. 38); but they are
  remarkably few. But he keeps a copy of Chaucer's Boethius always open
  before him, and takes from it passage after passage, usually with many
  alterations, abbreviations, expansions, and other disfigurements; but
  sometimes without any alteration at all. A few examples will suffice, as
  a large number of parallel passages are duly pointed out in the
  Notes.</p>

  <p><a name="sect11">§ 11</a>. In Chaucer's Boethius (bk. i. pr. 3. 10),
  when Philosophy, the heavenly visitant, comes to comfort the writer, her
  first words are:&mdash;'<i>O my norry</i>, sholde I forsaken thee now?'
  In the Testament (p. <a href="#page10">10</a>, l. 37), Heavenly Love
  commences her consolations with the same exclamation:&mdash;'<i>O my
  nory</i>, wenest thou that my maner be, to foryete my frendes or my
  servaunts?' The Latin text&mdash;'An te, <i>alumne</i>,
  desererem?'&mdash;does not suggest this remarkable mode of address.</p>

  <p>This, however, is a mere beginning; it is not till further on that
  plagiarisms begin to be frequent. At first, as at p. <a
  href="#page37">37</a>, the author copies the sense rather than the words;
  but he gradually begins to copy words and phrases also. Thus, at p. <a
  href="#page43">43</a>, l. 38, his '<i>chayres</i> of domes' comes from
  Chaucer's 'heye <i>chayres</i>' in bk. i. met. 5. 27; and then, in the
  next line, we find '<i>vertue, shynende naturelly ... is hid</i> under
  cloude,' where Chaucer has '<i>vertu</i>, cler-<i>shyninge naturelly is
  hid</i> in derke derknesses'; bk. i. met. 5. 28. At p. <a
  href="#page44">44</a>, l. 66, we have: '<i>Whan nature brought thee
  forth</i>, come thou not <i>naked out of thy moders wombe</i>? Thou
  haddest no richesse'; where Chaucer has: '<i>Whan</i> that <i>nature
  broughte thee forth out of thy moder wombe</i>, I receyved thee
  <i>naked</i>, and nedy of alle thinges'; bk. ii. pr. 2. 10. Just a few
  lines <!-- Page xxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>below (ll. 71-76) we have the sense, but
  not the words, of the neighbouring passage in Chaucer (ll. 23-25).
  Further literal imitations are pointed out in the Notes to l. 85 in the
  same chapter, and elsewhere. See, for example, the Notes to Book ii. ch.
  iv. 4, 14, 20, 61; ch. v. 15, 57, 65, 67, 79; ch. vi. 11, 30, 74, 117,
  123, 129, 132, 143; ch. vii. 8, 14, 20, 23, 30, 39, 50, 74, 95, 98, 105,
  109, 114, 117, 130, 135, 139, 148; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Those who require conviction on this point may take such an example as
  this.</p>

  <p>'O! a noble thing and clere is power, that is not founden mighty to
  kepe himselfe'; (p. <a href="#page70">70</a>, l. 20).</p>

  <p>'O! a noble thing and a cleer thing is power, that is nat founden
  mighty to kepen it-self'; Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 5. 5-7.</p>

  <p>The Latin text is: 'O praeclara potentia quae nec ad conseruationem
  quidem sui satis efficax inuenitur.' I see no reason for supposing that
  the author anywhere troubled himself to consult the Latin original.
  Indeed, it is possible to correct errors in the text by help of Chaucer's
  version; see the last note on p. <a href="#page461">461</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect12">§ 12</a>. We get the clearest idea of the author's
  method by observing his treatment of the House of Fame, 269-359. It is
  worth while to quote the whole passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p>If the reader will now turn to p. <a href="#page54">54</a>, l. 45, and
  continue down to l. 81 on the next page, he will find the whole of this
  passage turned into prose, with numerous cunning alterations and a few
  insertions, yet including all such words as are printed above in italics!
  That is, he will find all except the proverb in ll. 290, 291; but this
  also is not far off; for it occurs over the leaf, on p. <a
  href="#page56">56</a>, at l. 115, and again at p. <a
  href="#page22">22</a>, ll. 44-45! Surely, this is nothing but
  book-making, and the art of it does not seem to be difficult.</p>

  <p><a name="sect13">§ 13</a>. The author expressly acknowledges his
  admiration of Troilus (p. <a href="#page140">140</a>, l. 292); and it is
  easy to see his indebtedness to that poem. He copies Chaucer's curious
  mistake as to Styx being a pit (p. <a href="#page3">3</a>, l. 80, and the
  note). He adopts the words <i>let-game</i> (p. <a href="#page18">18</a>,
  l. 124) and <i>wiver</i> (p. <a href="#page129">129</a>, l. 27). He
  quotes a whole line from Troilus at p. <a href="#page27">27</a>, l. 78
  (see note); and spoils another one at p. <a href="#page34">34</a>, ch.
  viii. l. 5, a third at p. <a href="#page80">80</a>, l. 116, and a fourth
  at p. <a href="#page128">128</a>, ch. vii. l. 2. We can see whence he
  took his allusion to 'playing raket,' and to the dock and nettle, at p.
  <a href="#page13">13</a>, ll. 166, 167; and the phrase to 'pype with an
  yvè-lefe' at p. <a href="#page134">134</a>, l. 50.</p>

  <p>It is further observable that he had read a later text of Piers
  Plowman with some care, but he seems to quote it from memory, as at p. <a
  href="#page18">18</a>, l. 153, and p. <a href="#page24">24</a>, l. 118. A
  few other passages in which he seems to have taken ideas from this
  popular and remarkable poem are pointed out in the Notes. It is <!-- Page
  xxviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>probable that he thence adopted the
  words <i>legistres</i> and <i>skleren</i>; for which see the Glossary,
  and consult the Notes for the references which are there given.</p>

  <p><a name="sect14">§ 14</a>. The author is frequently guilty of gross
  inaccuracies. He seems to confuse Cain with Ham (p. <a
  href="#page52">52</a>, ll. 107, 109), but <i>Cayn</i>, says Mr. Bradley,
  may be Thynne's misprint for <i>Cam</i>, i.e. Ham. He certainly confuses
  Perdiccas with Arrhidæus (p. <a href="#page52">52</a>, l. 116). He speaks
  of the <i>eighth</i> year, instead of the <i>seventh</i>, as being a
  sabbatical year, and actually declares that the ordinary week contains
  <i>seven</i> working-days (p. <a href="#page24">24</a>, ll. 102-104)! He
  tells us that Sunday begins 'at the first hour after noon (!) on
  Saturday' (p. <a href="#page82">82</a>, l. 163). Hence it is not to be
  wondered at that some of his arguments and illustrations are quite
  unintelligible.</p>

  <p><a name="sect15">§ 15</a>. The title of the work, viz. <span
  class="sc">The Testament of Love</span>, readily reminds us of the
  passage in Gower already quoted in vol. iii. p. xliii., in which the
  goddess Venus proposes that Chaucer should write 'his testament of love,'
  in order 'to sette an ende of alle his werke.' I have already explained
  that the real reference in this passage is to the Legend of Good Women;
  but I am not prepared, at present, to discuss the connection between the
  expression in Gower and the treatise by Usk. The fact that our author
  adopted the above title may have led to the notion that Chaucer wrote the
  treatise here discussed; but it is quite clear that he had nothing to do
  with it.</p>

  <p>Professor Morley well says that 'the writer of this piece uses the
  word Testament in the old Scriptural sense of a witnessing, and means by
  Love the Divine Love, the Christian spirit encouraging and directing the
  wish for the grace of God, called Margaret, the pearl beyond all price.'
  To which, however, it is highly essential to add that Margaret is not
  used in the sense of 'grace' alone, but is also employed, in several
  passages, to signify 'the visible Church of Christ.' The author is, in
  fact, careful to warn us of the varying, the almost Protean sense of the
  word at p. <a href="#page145">145</a>, where he tells us that 'Margarite,
  a woman [i.e. properly a woman's name], betokeneth <i>grace</i>,
  <i>lerning</i>, or <i>wisdom of god</i>, or els <i>holy church</i>.' His
  object seems to have been to extend the meaning of the word so as to give
  him greater scope for ingenuity in varying his modes of reference to it.
  He has certainly succeeded in adding to the obscurity of his subject.
  That by 'holy church' he meant the visible Church of Christ of his <!--
  Page xxix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxix"></a>[xxix]</span>own time, appears from the remarkable
  assertion that it is 'deedly,' i.e. mortal (p. <a href="#page94">94</a>,
  l. 121). Such an epithet is inapplicable to the Church in its spiritual
  character. It may also be observed that, however much the sense implied
  by Margarite may vary, it never takes the meaning which we should most
  readily assign to it; i.e. it never means a live woman, nor represents
  even an imaginary object of natural human affection. The nearest approach
  to such an ideal is at p. <a href="#page94">94</a>, l. 114, where we are
  told that the jewel which he hopes to attain is as precious a pearl as a
  woman is by nature.</p>

  <p><a name="sect16">§ 16</a>. It hardly seems worth while to give a
  detailed analysis of the whole piece. An analysis of the First Book
  (which is, on the whole, the best) is given by Professor Morley; and the
  hints which I have already given as to the character and situation of the
  author will enable the reader to regard the treatise from a right point
  of view. But it is proper to observe that the author himself tells us how
  he came to divide the work into three books<a name="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>, and what are the ideas on which each
  book is founded. Each of the three books has an introductory chapter.
  That to the First Book I have called a Prologue; and perhaps it would
  have been strictly correct to have called the first chapters of the other
  books by the same name. In the introductory chapter to the Third Book, p.
  <a href="#page101">101</a>, he declares that the First Book is
  descriptive of Error, or Deviation (which the editions print as
  Demacion!); the Second, of Grace; and the Third, of Joy. In other words,
  the First Book is particularly devoted to recounting the errors of his
  youth, especially how he was led by others into a conspiracy against the
  state and into deviation from orthodoxy. In the Prologue, he excuses
  himself for writing in English, and announces the title of the work. He
  then assures us that he is merely going to gather up the crumbs that have
  fallen from the table, and to glean handfuls of corn which Boethius has
  dropped. 'A sly servant in his own help is often much commended'; and
  this being understood, he proceeds to help himself accordingly, as has
  already been explained.</p>

  <p><a name="sect17">§ 17</a>. <span class="sc">Book I: Ch. I.</span> In
  Chapter I, he describes his misery, <!-- Page xxx --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxx"></a>[xxx]</span>and hopes that the dice
  will turn, and implores the help of Margaret, here used (apparently) to
  typify the grace of God. He represents himself as being in prison, in
  imitation of Boethius; but I suspect that, <i>in the present passage</i>,
  the prison was metaphorical. (He had been imprisoned in 1384, and in 1387
  was imprisoned again; but that is another matter.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. II.</span> Heavenly Love suddenly appears to him,
  as Philosophy appeared to Boethius, and is ready to console and reclaim
  him. She is aware of his losses, and he tries to vindicate his constancy
  of character.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. III.</span> He describes how he once wandered
  through the woods at the close of autumn, and was attacked by some
  animals who had suddenly turned wild. To save himself, he embarks on
  board a ship; but the reader is disappointed to find that the adventure
  is wholly unreal; the ship is the ship of Travail, peopled by Sight,
  Lust, Thought, and Will. He is driven on an island, where he catches a
  glimpse of Love, and finds a Margaret, a pearl of price. He appeals to
  Love to comfort him.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. IV.</span> Love first reproves and then consoles
  him. She enquires further into his complaints.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. V.</span> She advises him to contemn such as have
  spoken against him. He complains that he has served seven years for
  Rachel, and prays for comfort in his eighth year. She exhorts him to
  perseverance.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. VI.</span> He here goes into several details as
  to his previous conduct. The authorities threatened to keep him in
  prison, unless he would reveal a certain secret or plot. He was afraid
  that the peace of his native place, London, would suffer; and to procure
  its peace, he 'declared certain points.' Being charged upon oath to
  reveal certain secret dealings, he at once did so; for which he incurred
  much odium.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. VII.</span> To prove that he had only spoken the
  truth, he offered wager of battle; and was justified by the fact that no
  one accepted it. He had not perjured himself, because his oath in the
  law-court was superior to his former oath of secrecy. He only meant
  truth, but was sadly slandered. It is absurd to be 'a stinking martyr' in
  a false cause.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. VIII.</span> Love tells him he has greatly erred,
  and must expect much correction. Earthly fame should be despised, whilst
  he looks for the fame that comes after death. <!-- Page xxxi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. IX.</span> Love vindicates the greatness of God
  and the goodness of His providence.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ch. X.</span> The author complains of his hard
  fortune; he has lost his goods and has been deprived of his office. Love
  explains that adversity teaches salutary lessons, and that the true
  riches may still be his own.</p>

  <p><a name="sect18">§ 18</a>. <span class="sc">Book II.</span> In the
  first chapter (or Prologue) of the Second Book, he again discusses the
  object of his work. In Chapter II, Love sings him a Latin song,
  introducing complaints against the clergy such as frequently occur in
  Piers the Plowman. In Chapter III, we find a discourse on womankind,
  largely borrowed from Chaucer's House of Fame. The next eight chapters
  are chiefly devoted to a discussion of the way by which the repentant
  sinner may come to 'the knot' of Heavenly bliss; and it is here, in
  particular, that a large portion of Chaucer's Boethius is freely imitated
  or copied. The last three chapters recount the excellences of Margaret,
  which in many passages refers rather to the visible Church than to divine
  Grace.</p>

  <p><a name="sect19">§ 19</a>. <span class="sc">Book III.</span> The first
  chapter is again introductory, explaining why the number of Books is
  three. 'The Margaret in virtue is likened to Philosophy, with her three
  kinds.' It is remarkable that this Third Book, which is dedicated to Joy,
  is the dullest of the three, being largely taken up with the questions of
  predestination and free will, with more borrowings from Chaucer's
  Boethius. In Chapter V, Love explains how continuance in good will
  produces the fruit of Grace; and, in Chapters VI and VII, shews how such
  grace is to be attained. Chapter IX recurs to the subject of
  predestination; after which the work comes to a formal conclusion, with
  excuses for its various imperfections.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect20" href="#piece2">§ 20. II. <span class="sc">The Plowmans Tale.</span></a></p>

  <p>This piece does not appear in Thynne's first edition of 1532, but
  occurs, for the first time, in the second edition of 1542, where it is
  added at the end of the Canterbury Tales, after the Parson's Tale. In the
  next (undated) edition, probably printed about 1550, it is placed
  <i>before</i> the Parson's Tale, as if it were really Chaucer's, and the
  same arrangement occurs in the fourth edition, that of 1561, by John
  Stowe. It is worth mentioning that some booksellers put forward a fable
  as to the true date of the undated <!-- Page xxxii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span>edition being 1539,
  in order to enhance the value of their copies; but the pretence is
  obviously false, as is shewn by collation<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>; besides which, it is not likely that
  the Plowman's Tale would have been <i>at first</i> inserted before the
  Parson's Tale, <i>then</i> placed after it, and then <i>again</i> placed
  before it. It is best to separate the first four editions by nearly equal
  intervals, their dates being, respectively, 1532, 1542, about 1550, and
  1561.</p>

  <p>Comparison of the black-letter editions shews that the first is the
  best; and the later ones, being mere reprints, grow gradually worse.
  Hence, in this case, the edition of 1542 is the sole authority, and the
  readings of the inferior copies may be safely neglected. It is remarkable
  that Mr. T. Wright, in his edition of this poem printed in his Political
  Poems and Songs, i. 304, should have founded his text upon a reprint of
  Speght in 1687, when he might have taken as his authority a text more
  than 140 years older. The result is, naturally, that his text is much
  worse than was at all necessary.</p>

  <p>According to Speght, there was once a MS. copy of this piece in
  Stowe's library, but no one knows what became of it. According to Todd,
  in his Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer, p. xxxix, there was once a
  black-letter edition of it, entitled 'The Plouuman's tale compylled by
  syr Geffray Chaucer knyght.' Todd says: 'It is of the duodecimo size, in
  the black letter, without date, and imprinted at London in Paules
  churche-yarde at the sygne of the Hyll, by Wyllyam Hyll. I have compared
  with the poem as printed by Urry forty or fifty lines, and I found almost
  as many variations between them<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. The colophon of this book is, <i>Thus
  endeth the boke of Chaunterburye Tales</i>. This rarity belongs to the
  Rev. Mr. Conybeare, the present Professor of the Saxon language in the
  University of Oxford.' This edition can no longer be traced. Hazlitt
  mentions a black-letter edition of this piece, printed separately by
  Thomas Godfray (about 1535), on twenty leaves; of which only one copy is
  known, viz. that at Britwell. There is also a late print of it in the
  Bodleian Library, dated 1606.</p>

  <p><a name="sect21">§ 21</a>. It is needless to discuss the possibility
  that Chaucer wrote this Tale, as it is absent from all the MSS.; and it
  does not <!-- Page xxxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span>appear that the ascription of it to
  him was taken seriously. It is obvious, from the introductory Prologue
  (p. <a href="#page147">147</a>), that the author never intended his work
  to be taken for Chaucer's; he purposely chooses a different metre from
  any that occurs in the Canterbury Tales, and he introduces his Ploughman
  as coming under the Host's notice quite suddenly, so that the Host is
  constrained to ask him&mdash;'what man art thou?' The whole manner of the
  Tale is conspicuously and intentionally different from that of Chaucer;
  and almost the only expression which at all resembles Chaucer occurs in
  ll. 51, 52:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'I pray you that no man me reproche</p>
      <p>Whyl that I am my tale telling.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer himself, before reciting his Tale of Melibeus, said much the
  same thing:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'And let me tellen al my tale, I preye.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I do not know why Mr. Wright, when reprinting this piece, omitted the
  Prologue. It is a pity that half of the sixth stanza is missing.</p>

  <p>It is generally agreed that the author here claims to have previously
  written the well-known piece entitled Pierce the Ploughman's Crede, which
  I edited for the Early English Text Society in 1867. I then took occasion
  to compare the language of these two pieces (which I shall shortly call
  the Crede and the Tale), and I found ample confirmation, from internal
  evidence, that the claim is certainly true. There are many similarities
  of expression, some of which I here lay before the reader.</p>

  <p>The Crede is written in alliterative verse; and it will be observed
  that alliteration is employed in the Tale very freely. Another
  peculiarity in the Tale may here be noticed, viz. the use of the same
  rime, <i>fall</i> or <i>befall</i>, throughout Part I, with the exception
  of ll. 205-228. Indeed, in the first line of Part II, the author
  apologizes for being unable to find any more rimes for <i>fall</i>, and
  proceeds to rime upon <i>amend</i> throughout that Part. In Part III, he
  begins to rime upon <i>grace</i> in the first two stanzas, but soon
  abandons it for the sake of freedom; however, at l. 1276, he recurs to
  <i>grace</i>, and continues to rime upon it till the end. It is clear
  that the author possessed considerable facility of expression. We can
  date these pieces approximately without much error. The proceedings
  against Walter Brute, expressly alluded to in the Crede, l. 657, lasted
  from Oct. 15, 1391, to Oct. 6, 1393, when he submitted himself to the
  bishop of Hereford. We may well date the Crede about 1394, and the Tale
  (which probably soon followed it, as the author repeats some of his
  expressions) about 1395<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Both these pieces are written in a spirited style, and are of
  considerable interest for the light which they throw upon many <!-- Page
  xxxv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span>of the
  corrupt practices of the monks, friars, and clergy. The Crede is directed
  against the friars in particular, and reflects many of the opinions of
  Wyclif, as will easily appear by comparing it with Wyclif's works. See,
  in particular, his Fifty Heresies and Errors of Friars (Works, ed.
  Arnold, iii. 366). It would have been easy to crowd the Notes with
  quotations from Wyclif; but it is sufficient to point out so obvious a
  source. I have not observed any passage in which the author copies the
  exact language of Langland. The dialect seems to be some form of Midland,
  and is somewhat archaic; many of the verbal forms are of some value to
  the philologist. Taken altogether, it is a piece of considerable interest
  and merit. Ten Brink alludes to it as 'that transparent, half-prophetic
  allegory of the Quarrel between the Griffin and the Pelican'; and
  adds&mdash;'The Griffin was the representative of the prelates and the
  monks, the Pelican that of real Christianity in Wyclif's sense. At a loss
  for arguments, the Griffin calls in at last all the birds of prey in
  order to destroy its rival. The Phoenix, however, comes to the help of
  the Pelican, and terribly destroys the robber-brood.'</p>

  <p>Tyrwhitt observed, with great acuteness, that Spenser's allusion, in
  the Epilogue to his Shepheards Calender, to 'the Pilgrim that the
  Ploughman playde awhyle,' may well refer to the author of the Plowman's
  Tale rather than to Langland<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. Cf. p. <a href="#page147">147</a>, l.
  12. It was natural that Spenser should mention him along with Chaucer,
  because their productions were bound up together in the same volume; a
  volume which was, to Spenser, a treasure-house of archaic words.</p>

  <p>The discussion on points of religion between the Griffin and the
  Pelican clearly suggested to Dryden his discussion between the Hind and
  the Panther. His choice of quadrupeds in place of birds is certainly no
  improvement.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect23" href="#piece3">§ 23. III. <span class="sc">Jack Upland.</span></a></p>

  <p>Of this piece, no MS. copy is known. It is usually said to have been
  first printed by Speght, in his second edition of Chaucer's Works in
  1602; but I have been so fortunate as to find a better <!-- Page xxxvi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>and
  earlier text in the library of Caius College, Cambridge, to which my
  attention was drawn by a note in Hazlitt's Bibliographer's Handbook. This
  copy, here taken as the basis of my text, and collated with Speght, is a
  small book consisting of only 16 leaves. The title-page contains the
  following words, within a square border. ¶ Jack vp Lande | Compyled by
  the | famous Geoffrey | Chaucer. | Ezechielis. xiii. | ¶ Wo be vnto you
  that | dishonour me to me (<i>sic</i>) peo | ple for an handful of bar |
  lye &amp; for a pece of bread. | Cum priuilegio | Regali.</p>

  <p>At the end of the treatise is the colophon: ¶ Prynted for Ihon Gough.
  Cum Priuilegio Regali.</p>

  <p>Hazlitt conjectures that it was printed about 1540. I think we may
  safely date it in 1536; for it is bound up in a volume with several other
  tracts, and it so happens that the tract next following it is by Myles
  Coverdale, and is dated 1536, being printed in just the very same type
  and style. We can also tell that it must have been printed after 1535,
  because the verse from Ezekiel xiii, as quoted on the title-page (see
  above), exactly corresponds with Coverdale's version of the Bible, the
  first edition of which appeared in that year.</p>

  <p>The text of Jack Upland, in the Caius College copy, has the following
  heading, in small type:&mdash;'¶ These b&#x113; the lewed questions of
  Freres rytes and obseruaunces the whych they chargen more than Goddes
  lawe, and therfore men shulden not gyue hem what so they beggen, tyll
  they hadden answered and clerely assoyled these questions.'</p>

  <p>As this copy is, on the whole, considerably superior to Speght's both
  as regards sense and spelling, I have not given his inferior readings and
  errors. In a very few places, Speght furnishes some obvious corrections;
  and in such instances his readings are noted.</p>

  <p><a name="sect24">§ 24</a>. A very convenient reprint of Speght's text
  is given in Wright's edition of Political Poems and Songs (Record
  Series), vol. ii. p. 16. In the same volume, p. 39, is printed a reply to
  Jack Upland's questions by a friar who facetiously calls himself Friar
  Daw Topias, though it appears (from a note printed at p. 114) that his
  real name was John Walsingham. Nor is this all; for Friar Daw's reply is
  further accompanied by Jack Upland's rejoinder, printed, for convenience,
  below Friar Daw's text. It is most likely, as Mr. Wright concludes, that
  all three pieces may be <!-- Page xxxvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>dated in the same year. It was
  necessary that Friar Daw (who gave himself this name in order to indicate
  that he is a comparatively unlearned man, yet easily able to refute his
  audacious questioner) should produce his reply at once; and we may be
  sure that Jack's rejoinder was not long delayed. Fortunately, the date
  can be determined with sufficient exactness; for Jack's rejoinder
  contains the allusion: 'and the kyng by his juges trwe [sholde] execute
  his lawe, as he <i>did now late</i>, whan he hangid you traytours,' p.
  86. This clearly refers to June, 1402<a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>, when eight Franciscan friars were
  hanged at Tyburn for being concerned in a plot against the life of Henry
  IV. We may, accordingly, safely refer all three pieces to the year 1402;
  shortly after Chaucer's death.</p>

  <p><a name="sect25">§ 25</a>. It is also tolerably clear that there must
  have been two texts of 'Jack Upland,' an earlier and a later one. The
  earlier one, of which we have no copy, can easily be traced by help of
  Friar Daw's reply, as he quotes all that is material point by point. It
  only extended as far as the 54th question in the present edition (p. <a
  href="#page199">199</a>); after which followed two more questions which
  do not here reappear. The later copy also contains a few questions, not
  far from the beginning, which Friar Daw ignores. It is clear that we only
  possess a later, and, on the whole, a fuller copy. One of the omitted
  questions relates to transubstantiation; and, as any discussion of it was
  extremely likely, at that date, to be ended by burning the disputant at
  the stake, it was certainly prudent to suppress it. Not perceiving this
  point, Mr. Wright too hastily concluded that our copy of Jack Upland is
  extremely corrupt, a conclusion quite unwarranted; inasmuch as Friar Daw,
  in spite of his affectation of alliterative verse, quotes his adversary's
  questions with reasonable correctness. On this unsound theory Mr. Wright
  has built up another, still less warranted, viz. that the original copy
  of Jack Upland must have been written in alliterative verse; for no other
  reason than because Friar Daw's reply is so written. It is obvious that
  alliteration is conspicuously absent, except in the case of the four
  lines (424-7), which are introduced, by way of flourish, at the end. My
  own belief is that our copy of Jack Upland is a second edition, i.e. an
  amended and extended <!-- Page xxxviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span>copy, which has been reasonably
  well preserved. It is more correct than the Plowmans Tale, and very much
  more correct than the Testament of Love.</p>

  <p><a name="sect26">§ 26</a>. Mr. Wright further imagines that Jack
  Upland's rejoinder to Friar Daw's reply, which he prints from 'a
  contemporary MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, MS. Digby 41,' was
  also originally in alliterative verse. This supposition is almost as
  gratuitous as the former; for, although there are very frequent traces of
  alliteration as an occasional embellishment, it is otherwise written in
  ordinary prose. The mere chopping up of prose into bits of not very equal
  length, as in Mr. Wright's print, does not produce verse of any kind.
  Friar Daw's verses are bad enough, as he did not understand his model
  (obviously the Ploughman's Crede), but he usually succeeds in making a
  kind of jingle, with pauses, for the most part, in the right place. But
  there is no verse discoverable in Jack Upland; he preferred
  straightforward prose, for reasons that are perfectly obvious.</p>

  <p>For further remarks, I beg leave to refer the reader to Mr. Wright's
  Introduction, pp. xii-xxiv, where he will find an excellent summary of
  the arguments adduced on both sides. There is a slight notice of Jack
  Upland in Morley's English Writers, vi. 234.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect27" href="#piece4">§ 27. IV. <span class="sc">John Gower: The Praise of Peace.</span></a></p>

  <p>In Morley's English Writers, iv. 157, this poem is entitled 'De Pacis
  Commendatione,' on MS. authority (see p. <a href="#page216">216</a>). Mr.
  E. B. Nicholson, who has made a special study of Gower's poems, suggested
  'The Praise of Peace,' which I have gladly adopted. I am much obliged to
  Mr. Nicholson for his assistance in various ways; and, in particular, for
  the generous loan of his own transcript of this poem.</p>

  <p><a name="sect28">§ 28</a>. In Todd's Illustrations of Gower and
  Chaucer, p. 95, is a notice of a MS. 'in the present Marquis of
  Stafford's library at Trentham,' which had been previously described in
  Warton's Hist. of E. Poetry as being 'in Lord Gower's library.' Mr.
  Wright alludes to it as 'a contemporary MS. in the possession of his
  grace the duke of Sutherland.' It may be called 'the Trentham MS.' 'The
  Praise of Peace' was printed from it by Mr. Wright, in his Political
  Poems and Songs, ii. 4-15; and I have followed his text, which I denote
  by 'T.' At the same time, I have <!-- Page xxxix --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span>collated it with
  the text of Thynne's edition of 1532, which is a very good one. The
  differences are slight.</p>

  <p>Warton describes the MS. as 'a thin oblong MS. on vellum, containing
  some of Gower's poems in Latin, French, and English. By an entry in the
  first leaf, in the handwriting and under the signature of Thomas lord
  Fairfax, Cromwell's general, an antiquarian, and a lover and collector of
  curious manuscripts, it appears that this book was presented by the poet
  Gower, about 1400<a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>, to
  Henry IV; and that it was given by lord Fairfax to his friend and kinsman
  Sir Thomas Gower, knight and baronet, in the year 1656.' He goes on to
  say that Fairfax had it from Charles Gedde, Esq., of St. Andrews; and
  that it was at one time in the possession of King Henry VII, while earl
  of Richmond, who wrote in it his own name in the form 'Rychemond.'</p>

  <p>The MS. contains (1) The Praise of Peace, <i>preceded by</i> the seven
  Latin lines (386-392), which I have relegated to the end of the poem, as
  in Thynne. The title is given in the colophon (p. 216); after which
  follow the twelve Latin lines (393-404), printed on the same page. (2)
  Some complimentary verses in Latin, also addressed to Henry IV, printed
  in Wright's Political Poems, ii. 1-3. (3) Fifty Balades in French, which
  have been printed by Stengel (Warton prints <i>four</i> of them), with
  the colophon&mdash;'Expliciunt carmina Joh&#x12B;s Gower que Gallice
  composita <i>Balades</i> dicuntur.' (4) Two short Latin poems in
  elegiacs; see Warton. (5) A French poem on the Dignity or Excellence of
  Marriage. (6) Seventeen Latin hexameters. (7) Gower's Latin verses on his
  blindness, beginning&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>See Todd and Warton for more minute particulars.</p>

  <p><a name="sect29">§ 29</a>. The poem itself may safely be dated in the
  end of 1399, for reasons given in the note to l. 393. It is of some
  interest, as being Gower's last poem in English, and the spirit of it is
  excellent, though it contains no very striking lines. We have not much of
  Gower's work in the form of seven-line stanzas. The Confessio Amantis
  contains only twelve such stanzas; iii. 349-352. I draw attention to the
  earliest known reference (l. 295) to the game of 'tenetz'; the
  enumeration of the nine worthies (ll. 281-3); <!-- Page xl --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexl"></a>[xl]</span>and the reference to a
  story about Constantine which, in the Confessio Amantis, is related at
  considerable length (l. 339).</p>

  <p>We may compare with this poem the stanzas in praise of peace in
  Hoccleve's De Regimine Principum, quoted in Morley's English Writers
  (1890), vol. vi. pp. 131-2.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect30" href="#piece5">§ 30. V. <span class="sc">Thomas Hoccleve: The Letter of Cupid.</span></a></p>

  <p>This poem needs little discussion. It is known to be Hoccleve's; see
  Dr. Furnivall's edition of Hoccleve's Minor Poems, E. E. T. S., 1892, p.
  72. As explained in the notes, it is rather closely imitated from the
  French poem entitled L'Epistre au Dieu d'Amours, written by Christine de
  Pisan. At the end of her poem, Christine gives the date of its
  composition, viz. 1399; and Hoccleve, in like manner, gives the date of
  his poem as 1402. The poem consists of sixty-eight stanzas, of which not
  more than eighteen are wholly independent of the original. The chief
  original passages are ll. 176-189, 316-329, and 374-434.</p>

  <p>The poem is entirely occupied with a defence of women, such as a woman
  might well make. It takes the form of a reproof, addressed by Cupid to
  all male lovers; and is directed, in particular, against the sarcasms of
  Jean de Meun (l. 281) in the celebrated Roman de la Rose.</p>

  <p>Of this poem there are several MS. copies; see footnotes at p. 217.
  The best is probably the Ashburnham MS., but it has not yet been printed.
  I chiefly follow MS. Fairfax 16, which Dr. Furnivall has taken as the
  basis of his text.</p>

  <p>There is also a poor and late copy in the Bannatyne MS., at fol. 269;
  see the print of it for the Hunterian Club, 1879; p. 783.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect31" href="#piece6">§ 31. VI. <span class="sc">The same: Two Balades.</span></a></p>

  <p>These two Balades, also by Hoccleve, were composed at the same time.
  The former is addressed to King Henry V, and the latter to the Knights of
  the Garter. They are very closely connected with a much longer poem of
  512 lines, which was addressed to Sir John Oldcastle in August, 1415; and
  must have been written at about that date. It was natural enough that,
  whilst addressing his appeal to Oldcastle to renounce his heresies, the
  poet should briefly address the king on the same subject at the <!-- Page
  xli --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexli"></a>[xli]</span>same time.
  I think we may safely date this piece, like the other, in August,
  1415.</p>

  <p>The remarkable likeness between the two pieces appears most in the
  references to Justinian and to Constantine. In fact, the reference to
  Justinian in l. 3 of the former of the Balades here printed would be
  unintelligible but for the full explanation which the companion poem
  affords. I have quoted, in the note to l. 3, the Latin note which is
  written in the margin of st. 24 of the address to Oldcastle; and I quote
  here the stanza itself:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'The Cristen emperour Justinian,</p>

      <p>That he were of, nat sholde hardy be</p>
      <p>For to despute of the feith openly;</p>

      <p style="margin-left:6.1em">Minor Poems, ed. Furnivall, p. 14.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Compare with this the fourth stanza of Balade I.</p>

  <p>We may regret that Hoccleve's desire to make an example of heretics
  was so soon fulfilled. Only three years later, in Dec. 1418, Sir John
  Oldcastle was captured in Wales, brought up to London, and publicly
  burnt.</p>

  <p>My text follows the sole good MS. (Phillipps 8151); which I have
  collated with the earliest printed text, that of 1542. There is, indeed,
  another MS. copy of the poem in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge
  (R. 3. 15); but it is only a late copy made from the printed book.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect32" href="#piece7">§ 32. VII. <span class="sc">Henry Scogan: A Moral Balade.</span></a></p>

  <p>The heading to this poem is from MS. Ashmole 59; it is, unfortunately,
  somewhat obscure. It is, of course, not contemporaneous with the poem,
  but was added, by way of note, by John Shirley, when transcribing it. In
  fact, the third son of Henry IV was not created duke of Bedford till
  1415, after the accession of Henry V; whereas Henry V is here referred to
  as being still 'my lord the Prince.' Hence the poem was written in the
  reign of Henry IV (1399-1413); but we can easily come much nearer than
  this to the true date. We may note, first of <!-- Page xlii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlii"></a>[xlii]</span>all, that Chaucer is
  referred to as being dead (l. 65); so that the date is after 1400. Again,
  the poem does not appear to have been recited by the author; it was
  <i>sent</i>, in the author's handwriting, to the assembled guests (l. 3).
  Further, Scogan says that he was 'called' the 'fader,' i.e. tutor, of the
  young princes (l. 2); and that he sent the letter to them out of fervent
  regard for their welfare, in order to warn them (l. 35). He regrets that
  sudden age has come upon him (l. 10), and wishes to impart to them the
  lessons which the approach of old age suggests. All this points to a time
  when Scogan was getting past his regular work as tutor, though he still
  retained the title; which suggests a rather late date. We find, however,
  from the Inquisitiones post Mortem (iii. 315), that Henry Scogan died in
  1407, and I have seen it noted (I forget where) that he only attained the
  age of forty-six. This shews that he was only relatively old, owing,
  probably, to infirm health; and we may safely date the poem in 1406 or
  1407, the latter being the more likely. In 1407, the ages of the young
  princes were nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, and sixteen respectively, and
  it is not likely that Scogan had been their tutor for more than twelve
  years at most. This provisional date of 1407 sufficiently satisfies all
  the conditions.</p>

  <p>The four sons of Henry IV were Henry, prince of Wales, born at
  Monmouth in 1388; Thomas, born in 1389, and created duke of Clarence in
  1412; John, born in 1390, created duke of Bedford in 1415; and Humphrey,

  merchande</i> is difficult, and I can only guess at the sense.
  <i>Feorthe</i> is Shirley's spelling of <i>ferthe</i>, i.e. fourth.
  <i>Merchande</i> is probably equivalent to O.F. <i>marchandie</i> or
  <i>marchandise</i>. Godefroy gives an example of the latter in the sense
  of 'merchant's company.' I suppose that <i>feorthe merchande</i> means
  'fourth meeting of merchants,' or the fourth of the four quarterly
  meetings of a guild. Toulmin Smith, in his English Gilds, p. 32, says
  that quarterly meetings for business were common; though some guilds met
  only once, twice, or thrice in the course of a year.</p>

  <p>The Vintry is described by Stow in his Survey of London (ed. Thoms, p.
  90): 'Then next over against St. Martin's church, is a large house built
  of stone and timber, with vaults for the stowage of wines, and is called
  the Vintry.... In this <!-- Page xliii --><span class="pagenum"><a

  1356-7] feasted four kings in one day.'</p>

  <p>I need not repeat here what I have already said about Scogan in vol.
  i. p. 83.</p>

  <p>I may add to the note about Lewis John (vol. i. p. 84), that he was a
  person of some note. In 1423 (Feb. 8), 'Ludowicus Johan, armiger,
  constitutus est seneschall et receptor generalis ducatus Cornub.': see
  Ordinances of the Privy Council, iii. 24. He is further mentioned in the
  same, ii. 334, 342.</p>

  <p>Chaucer's Balade on Gentilesse, quoted in full in ll. 105-125, is in
  seven-line stanzas; and is thus distinguished from the rest of the poem,
  which is written in eight-line stanzas. It may be noted that Scogan's
  rimes are extremely correct, if we compare them with Chaucer's as a
  standard.</p>

  <p>Of this piece there are two early printed copies, one by Caxton, and
  one by Thynne (1532); and two MSS., Ashmole 59 and Harl. 2251. It is
  remarkable that the printed copies are better than the MSS. as regards
  readings.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect34" href="#piece8">§ 34. VIII. <span class="sc">The Complaint of the Black Knight.</span></a></p>

  <p>Such is the title in Thynne's edition (1532). In MS. F. (Fairfax 16),
  it is entitled&mdash;'Complaynte of a Loveres Lyfe'; and there is a
  printed edition with the title&mdash;'The Complaynte of a Louers Lyfe.
  Imprynted at London in the flete strete at the sygne of the Sonne, by
  Wynkyn de Worde'; no date, 4to. on twelve leaves. In MS. S. (Arch.
  Selden, B. 24), there is an erroneous colophon&mdash;'Here endith the
  Maying and disporte of Chaucere'; which gives the wrong title, and
  assigns it to the wrong author. In accordance with the last MS., it was
  printed, with the erroneous title&mdash;'Here begynnys the mayng or
  disport of chaucer'&mdash;in a volume 'Imprentit in the south gait of
  Edinburgh be Walter chepman and Androw myllar the fourth day of
  ap<i>er</i>ile the yhere of god . <span class="sm">M.CCCCC.</span> and
  viii yheris' [1508]; and this scarce copy was reprinted as piece no. 8 in
  The Knightly Tale of Golagrus and Gawane, &amp;c., as reprinted by Laing
  in 1827.</p>

  <p>But the fullest title is that in MS. Ad. (Addit. 16165), written out
  by John Shirley, who says: 'And here filowyng begynnethe a Right lusty
  amorous balade, made in wyse of a complaynt of a Right
  worshipfull<i>e</i> Knyght that truly euer serued his lady, <!-- Page
  xliv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexliv"></a>[xliv]</span>enduryng grete disese by fals envye and
  malebouche; made by Lydegate' (fol. 190, back). Some of the pages have
  the heading, 'The compleynte of a Knight made by Lidegate<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>.'</p>

  <p>This attribution of the poem to Lydgate, by so good a judge as
  Shirley, renders the authorship certain; and the ascription is fully
  confirmed by strong internal evidence. Much of it is in Lydgate's best
  manner, and his imitation of Chaucer is, in places, very close; while, at
  the same time, it is easy to point out non-Chaucerian rimes, such as
  <i>whyte</i>, <i>brighte</i>, 2; <i>pitously</i>, <i>malady</i> (Ch.
  <i>maladyë</i>), 137; <i>felyngly</i>, <i>malady</i>, 188; <i>mente</i>,
  <i>diligent</i>, 246; <i>grace</i>, <i>alas</i>, 529; <i>seyn</i>,
  <i>payn</i> (Ch. <i>peynë</i>), 568; <i>diurnal</i>, <i>fal</i>, (Ch.
  <i>falle</i>), 590; <i>payn</i>, <i>agayn</i>, 650; <i>queen</i> (Ch.
  <i>quene</i>), <i>seen</i>, 674. Besides which, there are two mere
  assonances in two consecutive stanzas, viz. <i>forjuged</i>,
  <i>excused</i>, 274; and <i>wreke</i>, <i>clepe</i>, 284. The occurrence
  of this pair of assonances is quite enough to settle the question. If we
  apply a more delicate test, we may observe that, in ll. 218-220, the word
  <i>s&#x14D;re</i> (with long <i>o</i>) rimes with <i>tore</i>, in which
  the <i>o</i> was originally short; on this point, see vol. vi. p.
  xxxii.</p>

  <p>As to this poem, Ten Brink well remarks: 'His talent was fairly
  qualified for a popular form of the 'Complaint'&mdash;a sort of long
  monologue, interwoven with allegory and mythology, and introduced by a
  charming picture of nature. His <i>Complaint of the Black Knight</i>,
  which contains reminiscences from the Romance of the Rose, the Book of
  the Duchesse, and the Parlement of Foules, was long considered a
  production of Chaucer's, and is still frequently included in editions of
  his works&mdash;although with reservations. The critic, however, will not
  be deceived by the excellent descriptive passages of this poem, but will
  easily detect the characteristic marks of the imitator in the management
  of verse and rhyme, and especially in the diffusiveness of the story and
  the monotony even of the most important parts.'</p>

  <p><a name="sect35">§ 35</a>. Lydgate's reminiscences of Chaucer are
  often interesting. In particular, we should observe the passages
  suggested by the Roman de la Rose in ll. 36-112; for we are at once
  reminded of Chaucer's <i>own version</i> of it, as preserved in Fragment
  A of the Romaunt. After noticing that he uses <i>costey</i> (36) for the
  F. <i>costoiant</i>, where Chaucer has <i>costeying</i> (134); and
  <i>attempre</i> (57) <!-- Page xlv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexlv"></a>[xlv]</span>where Chaucer has <i>attempre</i> (131),
  though one French text has <i>atrempee</i>, it is startling to find him
  reproducing (80) Chaucer's very phrase <i>And softe as veluët</i> (R. R.
  1420), where the French original has nothing corresponding either to
  <i>soft</i> or to <i>velvet</i>! This clearly shews that Lydgate was
  acquainted with Fragment A of the English version, and believed that
  version to be Chaucer's; for otherwise he would hardly have cared to
  imitate it at all.</p>

  <p>The date of this poem is discussed in the Introduction to Schick's
  edition of the Temple of Glas, by the same author; pp. c, cxii. He dates
  it in Lydgate's early period, or about <span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  1402.</p>

  <p>The text is based upon Thynne's edition, which is quite as good as the
  MSS., though the spellings are often too late in form. The late excellent
  edition by E. Krausser (Halle, 1896) reached me after my text was
  printed. His text (from MS. F.) has much the same readings, and is
  accompanied by a full Introduction and eleven pages of useful notes.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect36" href="#piece9">§ 36. IX. <span class="sc">The Flour of Curtesye.</span></a></p>

  <p>This piece has no author's name prefixed to it in the first three
  editions; but in the fourth edition by Stowe, printed in 1561, the title
  is: 'The Floure of Curtesie, made by Iohn lidgate.' Probably Stowe had
  seen it attributed to him in some MS., and made a note of it; but I know
  of no MS. copy now extant.</p>

  <p>Few poems bear Lydgate's impress more clearly; there can be no doubt
  as to its authorship. Schick refers it to Lydgate's early period, and
  dates it about 1400-1402; see his edition of the Temple of Glas, p. cxii.
  As it was written after Chaucer's death (see l. 236), and probably when
  that sad loss was still recent, we cannot be far wrong if we date it
  about 1401; and the Black Knight, a somewhat more ambitious effort, about
  1402.</p>

  <p>The 'Flour of Curtesye' is intended as a portrait of one whom the poet
  honours as the best of womankind. The character is evidently founded on
  that of Alcestis as described in the Prologue to the Legend of Good
  Women; and throughout the piece we are frequently reminded of Chaucer;
  especially of the Legend, the Complaint of Mars, and the Parliament of
  Foules.</p>

  <p>The Envoy presents a very early example of the four-line stanza,
  similar to that employed in Gray's famous Elegy. <!-- Page xlvi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect37" href="#piece10">§ 37. X. <span class="sc">A Balade in Commendation of our Lady.</span></a></p>

  <p>This piece is attributed to 'Lidegate of Bury' in the Ashmole MS. no.
  59; and the ascription is obviously correct. It abounds with evident
  marks of his peculiar style of metre; for which see Schick's Introduction
  to the Temple of Glas, p. lvi. We note in it a few reminiscences of
  Chaucer, as pointed out in the Notes; in particular, it was probably
  suggested by Chaucer's A B C, which furnished hints for ll. 27, 60, and
  129. It is perhaps worth while to add that we have thus an independent
  testimony for the genuineness of that poem.</p>

  <p>As an illustration of Lydgate's verse, I may notice the additional
  syllable after the cæsura, which too often clogs his lines. Thus in l. 8
  we must group the syllables thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Wherefór : now pláynly : I wól : my stýlë : dréssë. Similarly, we find
  <i>lícour</i> in l. 13, <i>pítè</i> (18), <i>líving</i> (24),
  <i>bémës</i> (25), <i>gínning</i> (31), <i>mércy</i> (33), <i>gárden</i>
  (36), &amp;c., all occupying places where a monosyllable would have been
  more acceptable.</p>

  <p>The poem is strongly marked by alliteration, shewing that the poet
  (usually in a hurry) took more than usual pains with it. In the seventh
  stanza (43-49) this tendency is unmistakably apparent.</p>

  <p>It is hardly possible to assign a date to a poem of this character. I
  can only guess it to belong to the middle period of his career; say, the
  reign of Henry V. We have not yet obtained sufficient data for the
  arrangement of Lydgate's poems.</p>

  <p><a name="sect38">§ 38</a>. Lines 121-127 are here printed for the
  first time. In the old editions, l. 120 is succeeded by l. 128, with the
  result that <i>Sion</i> (120) would not rime with <i>set afere</i> (129);
  but the scribe of the Ashmole MS. was equal to the emergency, for he
  altered l. 129 so as to make it end with <i>fuyrless thou sette
  vppon</i>, which is mere nonsense. Thynne has <i>fyrelesse fyre set
  on</i>, which is just a little better.</p>

  <p>This addition of seven lines was due to my fortunate discovery of a
  new MS.; for which I was indebted to the excellent MS. 'Index of First
  Lines' in the British Museum. This told me that a poem (hitherto
  unrecognised) existed in MS. Sloane 1212, of which the first line is 'A
  thousand stories,' &amp;c. On examining the MS., it turned out to be a
  copy, on paper, of Hoccleve's De Regimine Principum, with four leaves of
  vellum at the beginning, <!-- Page xlvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span>and two more at the end, covered with
  writing of an older character. The two vellum leaves at the end were then
  transposed, but have since been set right, at my suggestion. They contain
  a few lines of the conclusion of some other piece, followed by the unique
  <i>complete</i> copy of the present Balade. This copy turned out to be
  much the best, and restored several of the readings. Indeed, the Ashmole
  MS. is very imperfect, having in it a lacuna of eight stanzas (ll.
  64-119). I am thus able to give quite a presentable text.</p>

  <p>The correction that most interested me was one in l. 134, where the
  Ashmole MS. and Thynne have <i>probatyf piscyne</i>. On June 5, 1896, I
  read a paper at the Philological Society, in which (among other things) I
  pointed out that the right reading must certainly be <i>probatik</i>. The
  very next day I found the Sloane MS.; and behold, its reading was
  <i>probatyk</i>! It is not often that a 'conjectural emendation' is
  confirmed, on unimpeachable authority, within twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>Another remarkable correction is that of <i>dyamaunt</i> for
  <i>dyametre</i> in l. 87. It was all very well to compare Our Lady to a
  diamond; but to call her a <i>diameter</i> (as in all the editions) is a
  little too bad. Again, in l. 121 (now first printed) we have the
  remarkable expression <i>punical pome</i> for a pomegranate, which is
  worthy of notice; and in l. 123 we find a new word, <i>agnelet</i>, which
  is not to be found in the New English Dictionary.</p>

  <p>All the printed editions print the next piece as if it <i>formed a
  part</i> of the present one; but they have absolutely no point in common
  beyond the fact of having a common authorship.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect39" href="#piece11">§ 39. XI. <span class="sc">To my Soverain Lady.</span></a></p>

  <p>In all the old editions, this piece forms part of the preceding,
  though it is obviously distinct from it, when attention is once drawn to
  the fact. Instead of being addressed, like no. X, to the Virgin, it is
  addressed to a lady whose name the poet wishes to commend (l. 7); and
  from whom he is parted (51); whereas two lovers ought to be together, if
  they wish to live 'well merry' (64). Her goodly fresh face is a merry
  mirror (73); and he has chosen her as his Valentine (111).</p>

  <p>It is evidently a conventional complimentary poem, written to please
  some lady of rank or of high renown (93), one, in fact, <!-- Page xlviii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span>who is
  'of women chief princesse' (70). It is prettily expressed, and does
  Lydgate some credit, being a favourable specimen of his more playful
  style; I wish we had more of the same kind. L. 68&mdash;'Let him go love,
  and see wher [<i>whether</i>] it be game'&mdash;is excellent.</p>

  <p>I shall here submit to the reader a pure guess, for what it is worth.
  My impression is that this piece, being a complimentary Valentine, was
  suggested by queen Katherine's visit to England; the lover whose passion
  is here described being no other than king Henry V, who was parted from
  his queen for a week. The pair arrived at Dover on Feb. 2, 1421, and
  Henry went on to London, arriving on Feb. 14; the queen did not arrive
  till Feb. 21, just in time for her coronation on Feb. 23.</p>

  <p>This hypothesis satisfies several conditions. It explains why the
  lover's <i>English</i> is not good enough to praise the lady; why so many
  French lines are quoted; the significant allusion to the lily, i.e. the
  lily of France, in l. 16; the lover's consolation found in English
  roundels (40); the expression 'cheef princesse' in l. 70; and the very
  remarkable exclamation of <i>Salve, regina</i>, in l. 83, which doubtless
  made Thynne imagine that the poem was addressed to the Virgin Mary. The
  expression 'for your departing' in l. 105 does not necessarily mean 'on
  account of your departure from me'; it is equally in accordance with
  Middle-English usage to suppose that it means 'on account of your
  separation from me'; see <i>Depart</i> and <i>Departing</i> in the New
  English Dictionary.</p>

  <p>It is well known that Lydgate provided the necessary poetry for the
  entry of Henry VI into London in Feb. 1432.</p>

  <p>Some resemblances to Chaucer are pointed out in the Notes. The most
  interesting circumstance about this poem is that the author quotes, at
  the end of his third stanza, the first line of 'Merciles Beautè'; this is
  a strong point in favour of the attribution of that poem to his
  master.</p>

  <p>This piece is distinguished from the preceding by the difference of
  its subject; by the difference in the character of the metre (there is
  here no alliteration); and, most significant of all, by its absence from
  MS. Ashmole 59 and MS. Sloane 1212, both of which contain the preceding
  piece. The two poems may have been brought together, in the MS. which
  Thynne followed, by the accident of being written about the same time.
  <!-- Page xlix --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect40" href="#piece12">§ 40. XII. <span class="sc">Ballad of Good Counsel.</span></a></p>

  <p>The title of this piece in Stowe's edition stands as follows: 'A
  balade of good counseile, translated out of Latin verses into Englishe,
  by dan Iohn lidgat cleped the monke of Buri.' What were the Latin verses
  here referred to, I have no means of ascertaining.</p>

  <p>This Ballad is eminently characteristic of Lydgate's style, and by no
  means the worst of its kind. When he once gets hold of a refrain that
  pleases him, he canters merrily along till he has absolutely no more to
  say. I think he must have enjoyed writing it, and that he wrote it to
  please himself.</p>

  <p>He transgresses one of Chaucer's canons in ll. 79-82; where he rimes
  <i>hardy</i> with <i>foly</i> and <i>flatery</i>. The two latter words
  are, in Chaucer, <i>foly-ë</i> and <i>flatery-ë</i>, and never rime with
  a word like <i>hardy</i>, which has no final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i>.</p>

  <p>Lydgate is very fond of what may be called <i>catalogues</i>; he
  begins by enumerating every kind of possibility. You may be rich, or
  strong, or prudent, &amp;c.; or fair (22) or ugly (24); you may have a
  wife (29), or you may not (36); you may be fat (43), or you may be lean
  (46); or staid (57), or holy (64); your dress may be presentable (71), or
  poor (72), or middling (73); you may speak much (78) or little (80); and
  so on; for it is hard to come to an end. At l. 106, he begins all over
  again with womankind; and the conclusion is, that you should govern your
  tongue, and never listen to slander.</p>

  <p>Thynne's text is not very good; the MSS. are somewhat better. He makes
  the odd mistake of printing <i>Holynesse beautie</i> for <i>Eleynes
  beaute</i> (115); but Helen had not much to do with holiness. Two of the
  stanzas (71-7 and 106-112) are now printed for the first time, as they
  occur in the MSS. only. Indeed, MS. H. (Harl. 2251) is the sole authority
  for the former of these two stanzas.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect41" href="#piece13">§ 41. XIII. <span class="sc">Beware of Doubleness.</span></a></p>

  <p>This is a favourable example of Lydgate's better style; and is written
  with unusual smoothness, owing to the shortness of the lines. It was
  first printed in 1561. There is a better copy in the Fairfax MS., which
  has been taken as the basis of the text. The copy in MS. Ashmole 59 is
  very poor. The title&mdash;'Balade <!-- Page l --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagel"></a>[l]</span>made by
  Lydgate'&mdash;occurs in MS. Addit. 16165. Stowe, being unacquainted with
  the phrase <i>ambes as</i> (l. 78), though it occurs in Chaucer, turned
  <i>ambes</i> into <i>lombes</i>, after which he wrongly inserted a comma;
  and <i>lombes</i> appears, accordingly, in all former editions, with a
  comma after it. What sense readers have hitherto made of this line, I am
  at a loss to conjecture.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect42" href="#piece14">§ 42. XIV. <span class="sc">A Balade: Warning Men, etc.</span></a></p>

  <p>First printed by Stowe in 1561, from the MS. in Trinity College
  Library, marked R. 3. 19, which I have used in preference to the printed
  edition.</p>

  <p>There is another, and more complete copy in the same library, marked
  O. 9. 38, which has contributed some excellent corrections. Moreover, it
  gives a better arrangement of stanzas three and four, which the old
  editions transpose. More than this, it contains a unique stanza (36-42),
  which has not been printed before.</p>

  <p>The poem also occurs in Shirley's MS. Harl. 2251, which contains a
  large number of poems by Lydgate; and is there followed by another poem
  of seven stanzas, attributed to Lydgate. That the present poem is
  Lydgate's, cannot well be doubted; it belongs to the same class of his
  poems as no. XII above. I find it attributed to him in the reprint of
  'Chaucer's Poems' by Chalmers, in 1810.</p>

  <p>The substitution of the contracted and idiomatic form <i>et</i> for
  the later form <i>eteth</i> is a great improvement. It is due to MS. O.
  9. 38, where the scribe first wrote <i>ette</i>, but was afterwards so
  weak as to 'correct' it to <i>etyth</i>. But this 'correction' just ruins
  the refrain. <i>Et</i> was no doubt becoming archaic towards the middle
  of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>Two variations upon the last stanza occur in the Bannatyne MS., fol.
  258, back; see the print by the Hunterian Club, 1879, pp. 754, 755.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect43" href="#piece15">§ 43. XV. <span class="sc">Three Sayings.</span></a></p>

  <p>First printed by Stowe; I know of no MS. copy. The first two Sayings
  are attributed to Lydgate; so we may as well credit him with the third.
  The second expresses the same statements as the first, but varies
  somewhat in form; both are founded upon a Latin line which occurs in MS.
  Fairfax 16 (fol. 196) and in MS. Harl. <!-- Page li --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pageli"></a>[li]</span>7578 (fol. 20), and runs
  as follows:&mdash;'Quatuor infatuant, honor, etas, femina, uinum.'</p>

  <p>Note that these Three Sayings constitute the <i>only</i> addition made
  by Stowe to Thynne in 'Part I' of Stowe's edition. See nos. 28, 29, 30 in
  vol. i. p. 32. Stowe introduced them <i>in order to fill a blank
  half-column</i> between nos. 27 and 31.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect44" href="#piece16">§ 44. XVI. <span class="sc">La Belle Dame sans Mercy.</span></a></p>

  <p>First printed in Thynne's Chaucer (1532). Tyrwhitt first pointed out
  that it could not possibly be his, seeing that Alan Chartier's poem with
  the same name, whence the English version was made, could not have been
  written in Chaucer's lifetime. Chartier was born in 1386, and was only
  fourteen years old at the time of Chaucer's death. Tyrwhitt further
  stated that the author's name, Sir Richard Ros, was plainly given in MS.
  Harl. 372, fol. 61, where the poem has this title:&mdash;'La Belle Dame
  Sanz Mercy. Translatid out of Frenche by Sir Richard Ros.' I have not
  been able to find the date of the French original, as there is no modern
  edition of Chartier's poems; but it can hardly have been written before
  1410, when the poet was only twenty-four years old; and the date of the
  translation must be later still. But we are not wholly left to conjecture
  in this matter. A short notice of Sir Richard Ros appeared in Englische
  Studien, X. 206, written by H. Gröhler, who refers us to his dissertation
  'Ueber Richard Ros' mittelenglische übersetzung des gedichtes von Alain
  Chartier La Belle Dame sans Mercy,' published at Breslau in 1886; of
  which Dr. Gröhler has most obligingly sent me a copy, whence several of
  my Notes have been derived. He tells us, in this article, that his
  dissertation was founded on the copy of the poem in MS. Harl. 372, which
  (in 1886) he believed to be unique; whereas he had since been informed
  that there are three other MSS., viz. Camb. Ff. 1. 6, Trin. Coll. Camb.
  R. 3. 19, and Fairfax 16; and further, that the Trinity MS. agrees with
  the Harleian as to misarrangement of the subject-matter<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>. He also proposed to give a new edition
  of the poem in Englische Studien, but I am unable to find it; and Dr.
  Kölbing courteously informs me that it never appeared. <!-- Page lii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelii"></a>[lii]</span></p>

  <p>Dr. Gröhler further tells us, that Mr. Joseph Hall, of Manchester, had
  sent him some account, extracted from the county history of
  Leicestershire by Nichols, of the family of Roos or Ros, who were lords
  of Hamlake and Belvoir in that county. According to Nichols, the Sir
  Richard Ros who was presumably the poet, was the second son of Sir Thomas
  Ros; and Sir Thomas was the second son of Sir W. Ros, who married
  Margaret, daughter of Sir John Arundel. If this be right, we gain the
  further information that Sir Richard was born in 1429<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>, and is known to have been alive in
  1450, when he was twenty-one years old.</p>

  <p>The dates suit very well, as they suggest that the English poem was
  written, probably, between 1450 and 1460, or at the beginning of the
  second half of the fifteenth century; which sufficiently agrees with the
  language employed and with the probable age of the MSS. The date assigned
  in the New English Dictionary, s.v. <i>Currish</i>, is 1460; which cannot
  be far wrong. It can hardly be much later.</p>

  <p><a name="sect45">§ 45</a>. The above notice also suggests that, as Sir
  Richard Ros was of a Leicestershire family, the dialect of the piece may,
  originally at least, have been North Leicestershire. Belvoir is situate
  in the N.E. corner of Leicestershire, not far from Grantham in
  Lincolnshire, and at no great distance from the birthplace of Robert of
  Brunne. It is well known that Robert of Brunne wrote in a variety of the
  Midland dialect which coincides, to a remarkable extent, with the form of
  the language which has become the standard literary English. Now it is
  easily seen that La Belle Dame has the same peculiarity, and I venture to
  think that, on this account, it is worth special attention. If we want to
  see a specimen of what the Midland literary dialect was like in the
  middle of the fifteenth century, it is here that we may find it. Many of
  the stanzas are, in fact, remarkably modern, both in grammar and
  expression; we have only to alter the spelling, and there is nothing left
  to explain. Take for example the last stanza on p. 301 (ll.
  77-84):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'In this great thought, sore troubled in my mind,</p>
      <p>Alone thus rode I all the morrow-tide,</p>

      <p>In a gardén, where minstrels gan to play.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A large number of stanzas readily lend themselves to similar
  treatment; and this is quite enough to dissociate the poem from Chaucer.
  The great difficulty about modernising Chaucer is, as every one knows,
  his use of the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> as a distinct
  syllable; but we may search a whole page of La Belle Dame without finding
  anything of the kind. When Sir Richard's words have an extra syllable, it
  is due to the suffix <i><span class="nw">-es</span></i> or the suffix
  <i><span class="nw">-ed</span></i>; and even these are not remarkably
  numerous; we do not arrive at <i>cloth-ës</i>, a plural in <i><span
  class="nw">-es</span></i>, before l. 22; and, in the course of the first
  four stanzas, all the words in <i><span class="nw">-ed</span></i> are
  <i>awak-ed</i>, <i>nak-ed</i>, <i>vex-ed</i>, <i>tourn-ed</i>, and
  <i>bold-ed</i>, none of which would be surprising to a student of
  Elizabethan poetry. That there was something of a Northern element in Sir
  Richard's language appears from the rime of <i>long-es</i> with
  <i>song-es</i>, in ll. 53-55; where <i>longes</i> is the third person
  singular of the present tense; but modern English has <i>belongs</i>,
  with the same suffix! Again, he constantly uses the Northern possessive
  pronoun <i>their</i>; but modern English does the same!</p>

  <p><a name="sect46">§ 46</a>. Another remarkable point about the poem is
  the perfect smoothness and regularity of the metre in a large number of
  lines, even as judged by a modern standard. The first line&mdash;'Half in
  a dream, not fully well awaked'&mdash;might, from a metrical point of
  view, have been written yesterday. It is a pity that the poem is somewhat
  dull, owing to its needless prolixity; but this is not a little due to
  Alan Chartier. Sir Richard has only eight stanzas of his own, four at the
  beginning, and four at the end; and it is remarkable that these are in
  the seven-line stanza, while the rest of the stanzas have eight lines,
  like their French original, of which I here give the first stanza, from
  the Paris edition of 1617, p. 502. (See l. 29 of the English
  version.)</p>

  <p>I have cited in the Notes a few passages of the original text which
  help to explain the translation.</p>

  <p><a name="sect47">§ 47</a>. The text in Thynne is a good one, and it
  seemed convenient to make it the basis of the edition; but it has been
  carefully controlled by collation with MS. Ff. 1. 6, which is, in some
  respects, the best MS. I am not sure that Thynne always followed his MS.;
  he may have collated some other one, as he professes in some cases to
  have done. MS. Ff. 1. 6, the Trinity MS., and Thynne's principal MS. form
  one group, which we may call A; whilst the Fairfax and Harleian MSS. form
  a second group, which we may call B: and of these, group A is the better.
  The MSS. in group B sadly transpose the subject-matter, and give the poem
  in the following order; viz. lines 1-428, 669-716, 525-572, 477-524,
  621-668, 573-620, 429-476, 717-856. The cause of this dislocation is
  simple enough. It means that the B-group MSS. were copied from one in
  which three leaves, each containing six stanzas, were misarranged. The
  three leaves were placed one within the other, to form a sheet, and were
  written upon. Then the outer pair of these leaves was turned inside out,
  whilst the second and third pair changed places. This can easily be
  verified by making a little book of six leaves and numbering each page
  with the numbers 429-452, 453-476, 477-500, 501-524, &amp;c. (i.e. with
  24 lines on a page, ending with 716), and then misarranging the leaves in
  the manner indicated.</p>

  <p>The copy in MS. Harl. 372 was printed, just as it stands, by Dr.
  Furnivall, in his volume entitled Political, Religious, and Love Poems,
  published for the E. E. T. S. in 1866; at p. 52. The text is there,
  accordingly, misarranged as above stated.</p>

  <p>There is another MS. copy, as has been said above, in MS. Trin. Coll.
  Camb. R. 3. 19; but I have not collated it. It seems to be closely
  related to MS. Ff., and to present no additional information. Not only do
  the MSS. of the A-group contain the text in the right order, but they
  frequently give the better readings. Thus, in l. 47, we have the odd
  line&mdash;'My <i>pen</i> coud never have knowlege what it ment'; as
  given in MS. Ff., the Trinity MS., and Thynne. The word <i>pen</i> is
  altered to <i>eyen</i> in MSS. H. and F.; nevertheless, it is perfectly
  right, for the French original has <i>plume</i>; see the Note on the
  line. Other examples are given in the Notes. <!-- Page lv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelv"></a>[lv]</span></p>

  <p>In l. 174, MS. Ff. alone has the right reading, <i>apert</i>. I had
  made up my mind that this was the right reading even before consulting
  that MS., because the old reading&mdash;'One wyse nor other, prevy nor
  <i>perte</i>'&mdash;is so extremely harsh. There is no sense in using the
  clipped form of the word when the true <i>and usual</i> form will scan so
  much better. See C. T., F 531, Ho. Fame, 717. The Trinity MS. gets out of
  the difficulty by a material alteration of the line, so that it there
  becomes&mdash;'In any wyse, nether preuy nor perte.'</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect48" href="#piece17">§ 48. XVII. <span class="sc">The Testament of Cresseid.</span></a></p>

  <p>I do not suppose this was ever supposed to be Chaucer's even by
  Thynne. Line 64&mdash;'Quha wait gif all that Chaucer wrait was
  trew?'&mdash;must have settled the question from the first. No doubt
  Thynne added it simply as a pendant to Troilus, and he must have had a
  copy before him in the Northern dialect, which he modified as well as he
  could. Nevertheless, he gives us <i>can</i> for the Southern <i>gan</i>
  in l. 6, <i>wrate</i> for <i>wrote</i> in l. 64, and has many similar
  Northern forms.</p>

  <p>The poem was printed at Edinburgh in 1593 with the author's name. The
  title is as follows&mdash;¶ <b>The Testament of</b> CRESSEID, Compylit be
  M. Robert Henrysone, Sculemai-ster in Dunfermeling. <b>Imprentit at
  Edin</b> = burgh be Henrie Charteris. <span class="sm">MD. XCIII.</span>
  The text is in 4to, ten leaves, black-letter. Only one copy has been
  preserved, which is now in the British Museum; but it was reprinted page
  for page in the volume presented by Mr. Chalmers to the Bannatyne Club in
  1824. The present edition is from this reprint, with very few
  modifications, such as <i>sh</i> for <i>sch</i>, and final <i><span
  class="nw">-y</span></i> for final <i><span class="nw">-ie</span></i> in
  immaterial cases. All other modifications are accounted for in the
  footnotes below. No early MS. copy is known; there was once a copy in the
  Asloan MS., but the leaves containing it are lost.</p>

  <p>Thynne's print must have been a good deal altered from the original,
  to make it more intelligible. It is odd to find him altering
  <i>quhisling</i> (20) to <i>whiskyng</i>, and <i>ringand</i> (144) to
  <i>tynkyng</i>. I note all Thynne's variations that are of any interest.
  He must have been much puzzled by <i>aneuch in</i> (which he seems to
  have regarded as one word and as a past participle) before he turned it
  into <i>enewed</i> (110). But in some cases Thynne gives us real help, as
  I will now point out. <!-- Page lvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelvi"></a>[lvi]</span></p>

  <p>In l. 48, E. (the Edinburgh edition) has&mdash;'Quhill Esperus
  reioisit him agane'; where <i>Esperus</i> gives no good sense. But Thynne
  prints <i>esperous</i>, which at once suggests <i>esperans</i> (hope), as
  opposed to <i>wanhope</i> in the preceding line.</p>

  <p>In l. 155, E. has <i>frosnit</i>, which Laing interprets 'frozen,' as
  if the pp. of <i>freeze</i> could have both a strong and weak pp. suffix
  at the same moment! But Thynne has <i>frounsed</i>, evidently put for
  <i>fronsit</i>, as used elsewhere by Henryson in The Fable of the Paddock
  and the Mous, l. 43:&mdash;'The Mous beheld unto her <i>fronsit</i>
  face.' A printer's error of <i>sn</i> for <i>ns</i> is not
  surprising.</p>

  <p>In ll. 164, 178, 260, E. has <i>gyis</i> or <i>gyse</i>; but Thynne
  has preserved the true Chaucerian word <i>gyte</i>, which the printer
  evidently did not understand. It is true that in l. 164 he turned it into
  <i>gate</i>; but when he found it recur, he let it alone.</p>

  <p>In l. 205, E. has <i>upricht</i> (!); which Thynne corrects.</p>

  <p>In l. 290, Th. has <i>iniure</i> for <i>iniurie</i>, and I think he is
  right, though I have let <i>injurie</i> stand; <i>iniure</i> is Chaucer's
  form (Troil. iii. 1018), and it suits the scansion better.</p>

  <p>In l. 382, Thynne corrects <i>Unto</i> to <i>To</i>; and in l. 386,
  has <i>Beuer</i> for <i>bawar</i>. In l. 441, he has <i>syder</i> for
  <i>ceder</i>. In l. 501, he has <i>plyte</i> for <i>plye</i>, where a
  letter may have dropped out in E.; but see the note (p. 525). In l. 590,
  his reading <i>tokenyng</i> suggests that <i>takning</i> (as in E.)
  should be <i>takining</i> or <i>takinning</i>; the line will then scan.
  The contracted form <i>taikning</i> occurs, however, in l. 232, where the
  word is less emphatic.</p>

  <p>Note further, that in l. 216 the original must have had
  <i>Philogoney</i> (see the Note). This appears in the astonishing forms
  <i>Philologie</i> (E.), and <i>Philologee</i> (Th.). Laing prints
  <i>Phlegonie</i>, which will neither scan nor rime, without any hint that
  he is departing from his exemplar. All his corrections are made silently,
  so that one cannot tell where they occur without reference to the
  original.</p>

  <p>For further information concerning Robert Henryson, schoolmaster of
  Dunfermline, see the preface to David Laing's edition of The Poems and
  Fables of Robert Henryson, Edinburgh, 1865; and Morley's English Writers,
  1890, vol. vi. p. 250. He is supposed to have been born about 1425, and
  to have died about 1500. On Sept. 10, 1462, the Venerable Master Robert
  Henrysone, Licentiate in Arts and Bachelor in Decrees, was incorporated
  or admitted a member of the newly founded university <!-- Page lvii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelvii"></a>[lvii]</span>of Glasgow;
  and he is known to have been a notary public. Perhaps The Testament of
  Cresseid was written about 1460. It is a rather mature performance, and
  is his best piece. Perhaps it is the best piece in the present
  volume.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect49" href="#piece18">§ 49. XVIII. <span class="sc">The Cuckoo and the Nightingale.</span></a></p>

  <p>Of this piece there are several MSS., which fall into two main
  classes: (A)&mdash;Ff. (Ff. 1. 6, in the Camb. Univ. Library); T. (Tanner
  346); Th. (MS. used by Thynne, closely allied to T.); and (B)&mdash;F.
  (Fairfax 16), and B. (Bodley 638), which are closely allied. There is
  also S. (Selden, B. 24) imperfect, which has readings of its own<a
  name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>. Of these groups, A is
  the better, and MS. Ff. is, in some respects, the most important.
  Nevertheless, MS. Ff. has never been collated hitherto, so that I am able
  to give a somewhat improved text. For example, in all former editions
  lines 12 and 13 are transposed. In l. 180, the reading <i>haire</i> (as
  in Bell and Morris) is somewhat comic (see the Note). In l. 203, MS. Ff.
  restores the true reading <i>hit</i>, i.e. hitteth. Bell, by some
  accident, omits the stanza in which this word occurs. In vol. i. p. 39, I
  took occasion to complain of the riming of <i>now</i> with
  <i>rescow-e</i> in ll. 228-9, according to Bell. The right reading,
  however, is not <i>now</i>, but <i>avow-e</i>, which rimes well enough.
  MS. Selden has <i>allowe</i>, which Morris follows, though it is clearly
  inferior and is unsupported. On the other hand, MS. Selden correctly, and
  alone, has <i>leve</i> in l. 237; but the confusion between <i>e</i> and
  <i>o</i> is endless, so that the false reading <i>loue</i> creates no
  surprise.</p>

  <p>This poem is very interesting, and has deservedly been a favourite
  one. It is therefore a great pleasure to me to have found the author's
  name. This is given at the end of the poem in MS. Ff. (the best MS., but
  hitherto neglected), where we find, in firm distinct letters, in the same
  handwriting as the poem itself, the remark&mdash;<b>Explicit
  Clanvowe</b>. Remembering that the true title of the poem is 'The Book of
  Cupid, God of Love<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>,' I
  applied to Dr. Furnivall, asking him if he had met with the name. He at
  once referred me to his preface to Hoccleve's <!-- Page lviii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelviii"></a>[lviii]</span>Works, p. x, where
  Sir John Clanvowe and Thomas Hoccleve are both mentioned in the same
  document (about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1385). But Sir John Clanvowe
  died in 1391, and therefore could not have imitated the title of
  Hoccleve's poem, which was not written till 1402. Our poet was probably
  Sir Thomas Clanvowe, concerning whom several particulars are known, and
  who must have been a well-known personage at the courts of Richard II and
  Henry IV. We learn from Wylie's Hist. of Henry IV, vol. iii. p. 261, that
  he was one of twenty-five knights who accompanied John Beaufort (son of
  John of Gaunt) to Barbary in 1390. This Sir Thomas favoured the opinions
  of the Lollards, but was nevertheless a friend of 'Prince Hal,' at the
  time when the prince was still friendly to freethinkers. He seems to have
  accompanied the prince in the mountains of Wales; see Wylie, as above,
  iii. 333. In 1401, he is mentioned as being one of 'vi Chivalers' in the
  list of esquires who were summoned to a council by king Henry IV; see the
  Acts of the Privy Council, ed. Nicolas, temp. Henry IV, p. 162. (It may
  be noted that Sir John Clanvowe was a witness, in 1385, to the will of
  the widow of the Black Prince; see Testamenta Vetusta, ed. Nicolas.)</p>

  <p><a name="sect50">§ 50</a>. It now becomes easy to explain the
  reference to the queen at Woodstock, which has never yet been accounted
  for. The poem begins with the words&mdash;'<i>The God of Love!</i> Ah
  benedicite,' quoted from Chaucer, the title of the poem being 'The Book
  of Cupid, <i>God of Love</i>,' as has been said; and this title was
  imitated from Hoccleve's poem of 1402. But there was no queen of England
  after Henry's accession till Feb. 7, 1403, when the king married Joan of
  Navarre; and it was she who held as a part of her dower the manor and
  park of Woodstock; see Wylie, as above, ii. 284. Hence the following
  hypothesis will suit the facts&mdash;namely, that the poem, imitating
  Chaucer's manner, and having a title imitated from Hoccleve's poem of
  1402, was written by Sir Thomas Clanvowe, who held Lollard opinions<a
  name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and was a friend (at one
  time) of Henry of Monmouth. And it was addressed to Joan of Navarre,
  Henry's stepmother, queen of England from 1403 to 1413, who held as a
  part of her <!-- Page lix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelix"></a>[lix]</span>dower the manor of Woodstock. If so, we
  should expect it to have been written before April, 1410, when Thomas
  Badby, the Lollard, was executed in the presence of the prince of Wales.
  Further, as it was probably written early rather than late in this
  period, I should be inclined to date it in 1403; possibly in May, as it
  relates so much to the time of spring.</p>

  <p>I may add that the Clanvowes were a Herefordshire family, from the
  neighbourhood of Wigmore. The only remarkable non-Chaucerian word in the
  poem is the verb <i>greden</i>, to cry out (A.S. <i>gr&#x1E3;dan</i>); a
  word found in many dialects, and used by Layamon, Robert of Gloucester,
  Langland, and Hoccleve.</p>

  <p>The poem is written in a light and pleasing style, which Wordsworth
  has fairly reproduced. The final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> is
  suppressed in <i>assay-e</i> (l. 52). The non-Chaucerian rimes are few,
  viz. <i>gren-e</i> and <i>sen-e</i> as riming with <i>been</i> (61-5),
  shewing that Clanvowe cut down those dissyllables to <i>green</i> and
  <i>seen</i>. And further, the forms <i>ron</i> and <i>mon</i> are
  employed, in order to rime with <i>upon</i> (81-5); whereas Chaucer only
  has the form <i>man</i>; whilst of <i>ran</i> I remember no example at
  the end of a line<a name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect51">§ 51</a>. But there is one point about Clanvowe's
  verse which renders it, for the fifteenth century, quite unique. In
  imitating Chaucer's use of the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>,
  he employs this suffix with unprecedented freedom, and rather avoids than
  seeks elision. This gives quite a distinctive character to his
  versification, and is very noticeable when attention has once been drawn
  to it. If, for example, we compare it with the Parliament of Foules,
  which it most resembles in general character, we find the following
  results. If, in the Cuckoo and Nightingale, we observe the first 21
  lines, we shall find (even if we omit the example of <i>hy-e</i> in l. 4,
  and all the examples of final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> at the
  end of a line) the following clear examples of its
  use:&mdash;<i>low-e</i>, <i>lyk-e</i>, <i>hard-e</i>, <i>sek-e</i>,
  <i>hol-e</i> (twice), <i>mak-e</i>, <i>hav-e</i>, <i>wys-e</i>,
  <i>proud-e</i>, <i>grev-e</i>, <i>trew-e</i>, <i>hert-e</i>, i.e. 13
  examples, besides the 5 examples of final <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i> in <i>mak-en</i>, <i>bind-en</i>,
  <i>unbind-en</i>, <i>bound-en</i>, <i>destroy-en</i>. But in the first 21
  lines of the Parliament of Foules there are only 2 examples of the final
  <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> in the middle of a line, viz.
  <i>lust-e</i> (15) and <i>long-e</i> (21), whilst of the final <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i> there is none. The difference between 18 and 2
  must strike even <!-- Page lx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelx"></a>[lx]</span>the most inexperienced reader, when it is
  once brought under his notice. However, it is an extreme case.</p>

  <p>Yet again, if the <i>last</i> 21 lines in the Cuckoo be compared with
  ll. 659-679 of the Parliament (being the <i>last</i> 21 lines, if we
  dismiss the roundel and the stanza that follows it), we find in the
  former 7 examples of final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> and 2 of
  <i><span class="nw">-en</span></i>, or 9 in all, whilst in Chaucer there
  are 7 of final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>, and 1 of <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i>, or 8 in all; and this also happens to be an
  extreme case in the other direction, owing to the occurrence in the
  former poem of the words <i>egle</i>, <i>maple</i>, and <i>chambre</i>,
  which I have not taken into account.</p>

  <p>This suggests that, to make sure, we must compare much longer
  passages. In the whole of the Cuckoo, I make about 120 such cases of
  final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>, and 23 such cases of final
  <i><span class="nw">-en</span></i>, or 143 in all. In 290 lines of the
  Parliament of Foules, I make about 68 and 19 such cases respectively; or
  about 87 in all. Now the difference between 143 and 87 is surely very
  marked.</p>

  <p>The cause of this result is obvious, viz. that Chaucer makes a more
  frequent use of elision. In the first 21 lines of the Parl. of Foules, we
  find elisions of <i>men'</i>, <i>sor'</i>, <i>wak'</i>, <i>oft'</i>
  (twice), <i>red'</i> (twice), <i>spek'</i>, <i>fast'</i>, <i>radd'</i>;
  i.e. 10 examples; added to which, Chaucer has <i>joy(e)</i>, <i>love</i>,
  <i>knowe</i>, <i>usage</i>, <i>boke</i>, at the cæsura, and suppresses
  the <i>e</i> in <i>write</i> (written). But in ll. 1-21, Clanvowe has (in
  addition to <i>love</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>lowe</i>, <i>make</i> (twice),
  <i>gladde</i> at the cæsura) only 3 examples of true elision, viz.
  <i>fressh'</i>, <i>tell'</i>, and <i>mak'</i> (15).</p>

  <p>And further, we seldom find <i>two</i> examples of the use of the
  final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> in the <i>same</i> line in
  Chaucer. I do not observe any instance, in the Parl. of Foules, till we
  arrive at l. 94:&mdash;'Took rest that mad-<i>e</i> me to slep-<i>e</i>
  faste.' But in Clanvowe they are fairly common. Examples are: Of <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'seke-e'.">sek-<i>e</i></span>
  folk ful hol-<i>e</i> (7); For every trew-<i>e</i> gentil hert-<i>e</i>
  free (21); That any hert-<i>e</i> shuld-<i>e</i> slepy be (44); I
  went-<i>e</i> forth alon-<i>e</i> bold-e-ly (59); They coud-<i>e</i> that
  servyc-<i>e</i> al by rote (71); and the like. In l. 73, we have even
  <i>three</i> examples in <i>one</i> line; Some song-<i>e</i>
  loud-<i>e</i>, as they hadd-<i>e</i> playned. From all of which it
  appears that the critics who have assigned the Cuckoo to Chaucer have
  taken no pains whatever to check their opinion by any sort of analysis.
  They have trusted to their own mere opinion, without looking the facts in
  the face.</p>

  <p><a name="sect52">§ 52</a>. I will point out yet one more very striking
  difference. We know that Chaucer sometimes employs headless lines, such
  as: Twénty bókes át his béddes héed. But he does so sparingly, <!-- Page
  lxi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxi"></a>[lxi]</span>especially
  in his Minor Poems. But in the Cuckoo, they are not uncommon; see, e.g.
  lines 16, 50, 72, 100, 116, 118, 146, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158,
  161, 166, 205, 232, 242, 252, 261, 265, 268. It is true that, in Morris's
  edition, lines 72, 146, 153, 161, and 205 are slightly altered; but in no
  case can I find that the alteration is authorised. And even then, this
  does not get rid of the <i>five consecutive</i> examples in ll. 154-158,
  which cannot be explained away. Once more, I repeat, the critics have
  failed to use their powers of observation.</p>

  <p>I think the poem may still be admired, even if it be allowed that
  Clanvowe wrote it some three years after Chaucer's death.</p>

  <p><a name="sect53">§ 53</a>. At any rate, it was admired by so good a
  judge of poetry as John Milton, who of course possessed a copy of it in
  the volume which was so pleasantly called 'The Works of Chaucer.' That
  his famous sonnet 'To the Nightingale' owed something to Clanvowe, I
  cannot doubt. 'Thou with fresh hope the lover's heart dost fill' is, in
  part, the older poet's theme; see ll. 1-30, 149-155, 191-192. Even his
  first line reminds one of ll. 77, 288. If Milton writes of May, so does
  Clanvowe; see ll. 20, 23, 34, 55, 70, 230, 235, 242; note especially l.
  230. But the real point of contact is in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect54" href="#piece19">§ 54. XIX. <span class="sc">Envoy to Alison.</span></a></p>

  <p>This piece has always hitherto been printed <i>without any title</i>,
  and is made to follow The Cuckoo and the Nightingale, as if there were
  some sort of connection between them. This is probably because it happens
  to follow that poem in the Fairfax and Tanner MSS., and probably did so
  in the MS. used by Thynne, which has a striking resemblance to the Tanner
  MS. However, the poem is entirely absent from the Cambridge, Selden, and
  Bodley MSS., proving that there is no connection with the preceding poem,
  from which it differs very widely in style, in language, and in
  metre.</p>

  <p>I call it an Envoy to Alison. For first, it is an Envoy<a
  name="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>, as it refers to the
  author's 'lewd book,' which it recommends to a lady. What the book is, no
  one can say; but it may safely be conjectured that it was of no great
  value. And secondly, the lady's name was Alison, as shewn by the acrostic
  in lines 22-27; and the author has recourse to almost ludicrous efforts,
  in order to secure the first four letters of the name.</p>

  <p>Briefly, it is a very poor piece; and my chief object in reprinting it
  is to shew how unworthy it is of Clanvowe, not to mention Chaucer. We
  have no right even to assign it to Lydgate. And its date may be later
  than 1450.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect55" href="#piece20">§ 55. XX. <span class="sc">The Flower and the Leaf.</span></a></p>

  <p>This piece many 'critics' would assign to Chaucer, merely because they
  like it. This may be sentiment, but it is not criticism; and, after all,
  a desire to arrive at the truth should be of more weight with us than
  indulgence in ignorant credulity.</p>

  <p>It is of some consequence to learn, first of all, that it is hardly
  possible to separate this piece from the next. The authoress of one was
  the authoress of the other. That The Assembly of Ladies is longer and
  duller, and has not held its own in popular estimation, is no sound
  argument to the contrary; for it is only partially true. Between the
  first eleven stanzas of the Assembly and the first eleven stanzas of the
  present poem, there is a strong general resemblance, and not much to
  choose. Other stanzas <!-- Page lxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxiii"></a>[lxiii]</span>of the Assembly that are well up to
  the standard of the Flower will be found in lines 456-490, 511-539. The
  reason of the general inferiority of the Assembly lies chiefly in the
  choice of the subject; it was meant to interest some medieval household,
  but it gave small scope for retaining the reader's attention, and must be
  held to be a failure.</p>

  <p>The links connecting these poems are so numerous that I must begin by
  asking the reader to let me denote The Flower and the Leaf by the letter
  <b>F</b> (= Flower), and The Assembly of Ladies by the letter <b>A</b> (=
  Assembly).</p>

  <p>The first point is that (with the sole exception of the Nutbrown Maid)
  no English poems exist, as far as I remember, written previously to 1500,
  and purporting to be written by a woman. In the case of F. and A., this
  is assumed throughout. When the author of F. salutes a certain fair lady,
  the lady replies&mdash;'<i>My doughter, gramercy</i>'; 462. And again she
  says, '<i>My fair doughter</i>'; 467, 500, 547. The author of A. says she
  was one of five ladies; 5-7, 407. Again, she was a woman; 18. The author
  of A. and some other ladies salute Lady Countenance, who in reply says
  'fair sisters'; 370. Again, she and others salute a lady-chamberlain, who
  replies by calling them 'sisters'; 450; &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The poem A. is supposed to be an account of a dream, told by the
  authoress to a gentleman; with the exception of this gentleman, all the
  characters of the poem are <i>ladies</i>; and hence its title. The poem
  F. is not quite so exclusive, but it comes very near it; all the
  principal characters are ladies, and the chief personages are queens,
  viz. the queen of the Leaf and the queen of the Flower. The 'world of
  ladies' in l. 137 take precedence of the Nine Worthies, who were merely
  men. A recognition of this fact makes the whole poem much clearer.</p>

  <p>But the most characteristic thing is the continual reference to
  colours, dresses, ornaments, and decorations. In F., we have descriptions
  of, or references to, white surcoats, velvet, seams, emeralds, purfils,
  colours, sleeves, trains, pearls, diamonds, a fret of gold, chaplets of
  leaves, chaplets of woodbine, chaplets of <i>agnus-castus</i>, a crown of
  gold, thundering trumpets, the treasury of Prester John, white cloaks,
  chaplets of oak, banners of Tartary-silk, more pearls, collars,
  escutcheons, kings-of-arms, cloaks of white cloth, crowns set with
  pearls, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. Then there is a company all clad
  in one suit (or livery); heralds <!-- Page lxiv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxiv"></a>[lxiv]</span>and poursuivants,
  more chaplets and escutcheons, men in armour with cloth of gold and
  horse-trappings, with bosses on their bridles and peitrels&mdash;it is
  surely needless to go on, though we have only arrived at l. 246.</p>

  <p>In A., we have much the same sort of thing all over again, though it
  does not set in before l. 83. Then we meet with blue colours, an
  embroidered gown, and a purfil with a device. After a respite, we begin
  again at l. 206&mdash;'Her gown was blue'; and the lady wore a French
  motto. Diligence tells the authoress that she looks well in her new blue
  gown (259). At l. 305, there is another blue gown, furred with gray, with
  a motto on the sleeve; and there are plenty more mottoes to follow. At l.
  451 we come to a paved floor, and walls made of beryl and crystal,
  engraved with stories; next, a well-apparelled chair or throne, on five
  stages, wrought of 'cassidony,' with four pommels of gold, and set with
  sapphires; a cloth of estate, wrought with the needle (486); cloth of
  gold (521); a blue gown, with sleeves wrought tabard-wise, of which the
  collar and the <i>vent</i> (slit in front of the neck) are described as
  being like ermine; it was couched with great pearls, powdered with
  diamonds, and had sleeves and purfils; then we come to rubies, enamel, a
  great balas-ruby, and more of the same kind. Again, it is useless to go
  further. Surely these descriptions of seams, and collars, and sleeves,
  are due to a woman.</p>

  <p>The likeness comes out remarkably in two parallel stanzas. One of them
  is from F. 148, and the other from A. 526.</p>

      <p>We thanked her in our most humble wyse; A. 729.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Besides these striking coincidences in whole lines, there are a large
  number of phrases and endings of lines that are common to the two poems;
  such as&mdash;<i>the springing of the day</i>, F. 25, A. 218; <i>Which,
  as me thought</i>, F. 36, A. 50; <i>wel y-wrought</i>, F. 49, A. 165;
  <i>by mesure</i>, F. 58, A. 81; <i>I you ensure</i>, F. 60, 287, A. 52,
  199; <i>in this wyse</i>, F. 98, A. 589; <i>I sat me doun</i>, F. 118, A.
  77; <i>oon and oon</i>, F. 144, A. 368, 543, 710; <i>by and by</i>, F.
  59, 146, A. 87; <i>withouten fail</i>, F. 369, A. 567, 646; <i>herself
  aloon</i>, F. 458, A. 84; <i>ful demure</i>, F. 459, A. 82; <i>to put in
  wryting</i>, F. 589, A. 664; and others that are printed out in the
  Notes.</p>

  <p>Very characteristic of female authorship is the remark that the ladies
  vied with each other as to which looked the best; a remark which occurs
  in <i>both</i> poems; see F. 188, A. 384.</p>

  <p>A construction common to both poems is the use of <i>very</i> with an
  adjective, a construction used by Lydgate, but not by Chaucer; examples
  are <i>very rede</i>, F. 35; <i>very good</i>, F. 10, 315; <i>very
  round</i>, A. 479.</p>

  <p>It is tedious to enumerate how much these poems have in common. They
  open in a similar way, F. with the description of a grove, A. with the
  description of a garden with a maze. In the eighth stanza of F., we come
  to 'a herber that benched was'; and in the seventh stanza of A. we come
  to a similar 'herber, mad with benches'; both from The Legend of Good
  Women.</p>

  <p>In F., the authoress has a waking vision of 'a world of ladies' (137);
  in A. she sees in a dream the 'assembly of ladies.' In both, she sees an
  abundance of dresses, and gems, and bright colours. Both introduce
  several scraps of French. In both, the <!-- Page lxvi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxvi"></a>[lxvi]</span>authoress has
  interviews with allegorical or visionary personages, who address her
  either as daughter or sister. I have little doubt that the careful reader
  will discover more points of resemblance for himself.</p>

  <p><a name="sect56">§ 56</a>. The chief appreciable difference between
  the two poems is that F. was probably written considerably earlier than
  A. This appears from the more frequent use of the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i>, which the authoress occasionally uses as an
  archaic embellishment, though she frequently forgets all about it for
  many stanzas together. In the former poem (F.) there seem to be about 50
  examples, whilst in the latter (A.) there are hardly 10<a name="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>. In almost every case, it is correctly
  used, owing, no doubt, to tradition or to a perusal of older poetry. The
  most important cases are the abundant ones in which a final <i>e</i> is
  omitted where Chaucer would inevitably have inserted it. For example,
  such a line as F. 195&mdash;From the same grove, where the ladyes come
  out&mdash;would become, in Chaucer&mdash;From the sam-ë grov-ë wher the
  ladyes come out&mdash;giving at least twelve syllables in the line. The
  examples of the omission of final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>,
  where such omission makes a difference to the scansion, are not very
  numerous, because many such come before a vowel (where they might be
  elided) or at the cæsura (where they might be tolerated). Still we may
  note such a case as <i>green</i> in l. 109 where Chaucer would have
  written <i>gren-e</i>, giving <i>a fresh gren-ë laurer-tree</i>, to the
  ruin of the scansion. Similar offences against Chaucer's usage are
  <i>herd</i> for <i>herd-e</i>, 128 (cf. 191); <i>spek'</i> for
  <i>spek-e</i>, 140; <i>al</i> for <i>all-e</i>, plural, 165; <i>sight</i>
  for <i>sight-e</i>, 174; <i>lyf</i> for <i>lyv-e</i>, 182; <i>sam'</i>

  423, 549; <i>the hool</i> for <i>the hol-e</i>, 437; <i>to know</i> for
  <i>to know-e</i>, 453; <i>past</i> for <i>pass-ede</i> or <i>past-e</i>,
  465; <i>My fair</i> for <i>My fair-e</i>, vocative, 467, 500; <i>to
  tel</i> for <i>to tell-e</i>, 495; <i>nin(e)</i> for <i>nyn-e</i>, 502;
  <i>imagin(e)</i> for <i>imagin-en</i>, 525; <i>they last</i> for <!--
  Page lxvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxvii"></a>[lxvii]</span><i>they last-e</i>, 562; <i>thy
  rud(e)</i> for <i>thy rud-e</i>, 595. Those who believe that The Flower
  and the Leaf was written by Chaucer will have to explain away every one
  of these cases; and when they have done so, there is more to be said.</p>

  <p><a name="sect57">§ 57</a>. For it is well known that such a word as
  <i>sweetly</i> (96) was trisyllabic, as <i>swet-e-ly</i>, in Chaucer; C.
  T., A 221. Similarly, our authoress has <i>trewly</i> for
  <i>trew-e-ly</i><a name="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>, 130;
  <i>richly</i> for <i>rich-e-ly</i>, 169; <i>woodbind</i> for
  <i>wod-e-bind-e</i>, 485. Similar is <i>ointments</i> for
  <i>oin-e-ments</i>, 409. And, moreover, our authoress differs from
  Chaucer as to other points of grammar. Thus she has <i>Forshronk</i> as a
  strong pp., 358, which ought to be <i>forshronk-en</i> or
  <i>forshronk-e</i>. Still more marked is her use of <i>rood</i> as the
  <i>plural</i> of the past tense, 449, 454, where Chaucer has
  <i>rid-en</i>; and her use of <i>began</i> as a plural, 385, where
  Chaucer has <i>bigonn-e</i>. Can these things be explained away also? If
  so, there is more to be said.</p>

  <p><a name="sect58">§ 58</a>. All the above examples have been made out,
  without so much as looking at the rimes. But the rimes are much harder to
  explain away, where they differ from Chaucer's. Here are a few
  specimens.</p>

  <p><i>Pas-se</i> rimes with <i>was</i>, 27; so it must have been cut down
  to <i>pas</i>! Similarly, <i>hew-e</i> has become <i>hew</i>; for it
  rimes with <i>grew</i>, sing., 32. <i>Sight-e</i> has become
  <i>sight</i>, to rime with <i>wight</i>, 37. <i>Brought</i> should rather
  be <i>brought-e</i>, but it rimes with <i>wrought</i>, 48. Similar
  difficulties occur in <i>peyn</i> (for <i>peyn-e</i>), r. w. <i>seyn</i>
  (62); <i>syd'</i> for <i>syd-e</i>, r. w. <i>espy'd</i> for
  <i>espy-ed</i>, 72; <i>eet</i>, r. w. <i>sweet</i> for <i>swet-e</i>, 90;
  <i>not'</i> for <i>not-e</i>, r. w. <i>sot</i>, 99; <i>busily</i>, r. w.
  <i>aspy'</i> for <i>aspy-e</i>, 106; <i>trewly</i>, r. w. <i>armony'</i>
  for <i>armony-e</i>, 130; <i>orient</i> (<i>oriant</i>?), r. w.
  <i>want</i> for <i>want-e</i>, 148; <i>person</i> for <i>person-e</i>, r.
  w. <i>everichon</i>, 167. It is tedious to go on; let the critic finish
  the list, if he knows how to do it. If not, let him be humble. For there
  is more to come.</p>

  <p><a name="sect59">§ 59</a>. Besides the grammar, there is yet the
  pronunciation to be considered; and here comes in the greatest difficulty
  of all. For, in ll. 86-89, we have the unusual rime of <i>tree</i> and
  <i>be</i> with <i>pretily</i>. This so staggered Dr. Morris, that he was
  induced to print the last word as <i>pretile</i>; which raises the
  difficulty without explaining it. For the explanation, the reader should
  consult the excellent dissertation by Dr. Curtis on The Romance of
  Clariodus <!-- Page lxviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxviii"></a>[lxviii]</span>(Halle, 1894), p. 56, <a
  name="sect187">§ 187</a>. He remarks that a rime of this character gives
  evidence of the transition of M.E. long close <i>e</i> to (Italian) long
  <i>i</i> [as in the change from A.S. <i>m&#x113;</i> to mod. E.
  <i>me</i>], and adds: 'this change became general in the fifteenth
  century, but had begun in some dialects at an earlier date.' Its
  occurrence in the present poem is a strong indication that it is later
  than the year 1400, and effectually disposes of any supposed connection
  with Midland poems of the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>Both poems are remarkably free from classical allusions and from
  references to such medieval authors as are freely quoted by Chaucer.
  There is nothing to shew that the authoress was acquainted with Latin,
  though she knew French, especially the French of songs and mottoes.</p>

  <p>The Flower and the Leaf is chiefly famous for having been versified by
  Dryden. The version is a free one, in a manner all his own, and is finer
  than the original, which can hardly be said of his 'versions' of Palamon
  and Arcite and The Cock and the Fox. It is doubtless from this version
  that many critics have formed exaggerated ideas of the poem's value;
  otherwise, it is difficult to understand for what reasons it was
  considered worthy of so great a master as Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>

  <p><a name="sect60">§ 60</a>. It will be seen, from the Notes, that the
  authoress was well acquainted with the Prologue to The Legend of Good
  Women; and it can hardly be questioned that she took the main idea of the
  poem from that source, especially ll. 188-194 of the later text. At the
  same time she was well acquainted with Gower's lines on the same subject,
  in the Conf. Amantis, iii. 357, 358; see vol. iii. pp. xlii, 297. Gower

  <p>This has already been discussed, in some measure, in considering the
  preceding poem. Both pieces were written by the same authoress; but the
  former is the more sprightly and probably the earlier. With the exception
  of the unusual rime of <i>tree</i> with <i>pretily</i> (discussed above),
  nearly all the peculiarities of the preceding poem occur here also. The
  Chaucerian final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> appears now and then,
  as in <i>commaund-e</i> (probably plural), 203; <i>red-e</i>, 215;
  <i>countenanc-e</i>, 295; <i>pen-ne</i> [or else <i>seyd-e</i>], 307;
  <i>chayr-e</i>, 476; <i>tak-e</i>, 565; <i>trouth-e</i>, 647;
  <i>liv-e</i>, 672; <i>sem-e</i> (pr. s. subj.), 696. But it is usually
  dropped, as in <i>The fresh</i> for <i>The fres-she</i>, 2; &amp;c. In l.
  11, Thynne prints <i>fantasyse</i> for <i>fantasyes</i>; for it obviously
  rimes with <i>gyse</i> (monosyllabic); cf. 533-535. <i>Hew-e</i> and
  <i>new-e</i> are cut down to <i>hew</i> and <i>new</i>, to rime with
  <i>knew</i>, 67. <i>Bold</i> rimes with <i>told</i>, clipped form of
  <i>told-e</i>, 94; and so on. So, again, <i>trewly</i> appears in place
  of Chaucer's <i>trew-e-ly</i>, 488. It is needless to pursue the
  subject.</p>

  <p>The description of the maze and the arbour, in ll. 29-70, is good.
  Another pleasing passage is that contained in ll. 449-497; and the
  description of a lady's dress in ll. 519-539. As for the lady
  herself&mdash;</p>

  <p>To attribute such a question as 'how will my dress do' to a male

  <p><a name="sect62">§ 62</a>. A considerable part of The Assembly of
  Ladies that is now of little interest may have been much appreciated at
  the time, as having reference to the ordering of a large medieval
  household, with its chambers, parlours, bay-windows, and galleries,
  carefully kept in good order by the various officers and servants; such
  as Perseverance the usher, Countenance the porter, Discretion the chief
  purveyor, Acquaintance the harbinger, Largesse the steward, Bel-cheer the
  marshal of the hall, Remembrance the chamberlain, and the rest. The
  authoress must have been perfectly familiar with spectacles and pageants
  and all the amusements of the court; but she was too humble to aspire to
  wear a motto.</p>

  <p>We must not forget that the period of the Wars of the Roses,
  especially from 1455 to 1471, was one during which the composition of
  these poems was hardly possible. It is obviously very difficult to assign
  a date to them; perhaps they may be referred to the last quarter of the
  fifteenth century. We must not put them too late, because The Assembly
  exists in MSS. that seem to be as old as that period.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect63" href="#piece22">§ 63. XXII. <span class="sc">A Goodly Balade.</span></a></p>

  <p>For this poem there is but one authority, viz. Thynne's edition of
  1532. He calls it 'A goodly balade of Chaucer'; but it is manifestly
  Lydgate's. Moreover, it is really a triple Balade, with an Envoy, on the
  model of Chaucer's Fortune and Compleynt of Venus; only it has seven-line
  stanzas instead of stanzas of eight lines. An inspection of Thynne's
  volume shews that it was inserted to fill a gap, viz. a blank page at the
  back of the concluding lines of The Legend of Good Women, so that the
  translation of Boethius might commence on a new leaf.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that the third stanza of the second Balade was missing
  in Thynne's MS. He did not leave it out for lack of space; for there is
  plenty of room on his page.</p>

  <p>That it is not Chaucer's appears from the first Balade, where the use
  of the monosyllables <i>shal</i> and <i>smal</i> in ll. 8 and 10
  necessitates the use of the clipped forms <i>al</i> for <i>al-le</i>,
  <i>cal</i> for <i>cal-le</i>, <i>apal</i> for <!-- Page lxxi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxxi"></a>[lxxi]</span><i>apal-le</i>, and
  <i>befal</i> for <i>befal-le</i>. Moreover, the whole style of it
  suggests Lydgate, and does not suggest Chaucer.</p>

  <p>The sixth stanza probably began with the letter <i>D</i>; in which
  case, the initial letters of the stanzas give us <i>M</i>, <i>M</i>,
  <i>M</i>; <i>D</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>D</i>; <i>J</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>Q</i>.
  And, as it was evidently addressed to a lady named <i>Margaret</i> (see
  the Notes), we seem to see here <i>Margaret, Dame Jacques</i>. The name
  of <i>Robert Jacques</i> occurs in the Writs of Parliament; Bardsley's
  English Surnames, 2nd ed., p. 565. Of course this is a guess which it is
  easy to deride; but it is very difficult to account otherwise for the
  introduction of the letters <i>J</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>Q</i> in the third
  Balade; yet it was evidently intentional, for much force was employed to
  achieve the result. To make the first stanza begin with <i>J</i>,
  recourse is had to French; and the other two stanzas both begin with
  inverted clauses.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect64" href="#piece23">§ 64. XXIII. <span class="sc">Go forth, King.</span></a></p>

  <p>I give this from Thynne's first edition; but add the Latin lines from
  the copy printed in Schick's edition of The Temple of Glas, at p. 68. His
  text is from that printed by Wynken de Worde about 1498, collated with
  the second and third prints from the same press at somewhat later dates,
  and a still later copy printed by Berthelet.</p>

  <p>The only difference between Thynne's text and that given by Schick is
  that Wynken de Worde printed <i>ar</i> in the last line where Thynne has
  printed <i>be</i>. Schick also notes that 'the Chaucer-Prints of 1561 and
  1598 omit <i>thou</i>' in l. 9; and I find that it is also omitted in the
  third edition (undated, about 1550). But it occurs in the edition of
  1532, all the same; shewing that the later reprints cannot always be
  relied upon.</p>

  <p>I have already said (vol. i. p. 40)&mdash;'Surely it must be
  Lydgate's.' For it exhibits his love for 'catalogues,' and presents his
  peculiarities of metre. Dr. Schick agrees with this ascription, and
  points out that its appearance in the four prints above-mentioned, in all
  of which it is annexed to Lydgate's Temple of Glas, tends to strengthen
  my supposition. I think this may be taken as removing all doubt on the
  subject.</p>

  <p><a name="sect65">§ 65</a>. I beg leave to quote here Schick's
  excellent remarks upon the poem itself.</p>

  <p>'There are similar pieces to these <i>Duodecim Abusiones</i> in
  earlier <!-- Page lxxii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxii"></a>[lxxii]</span>English literature (see ten Brink,
  <i>Geschichte der englischen Literatur</i>, i. 268, and note).<a
  name="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> The "twelf
  unþ&#x113;awas" existed also in Old-English; a homily on them is printed

  href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>. It is based on the Latin Homily "De
  octo viciis et de duodecim abusivis huius saeculi," attributed to St.
  Cyprian or St. Patrick; see Dietrich in Niedner's <i>Zeitschrift für
  historische Theologie</i>, 1855, p. 518; Wanley's <i>Catalogus</i>,
  passim (cf. the Index <i>sub voce</i> Patrick). In the Middle-English
  period we meet again with more or less of these "Abusions"; see Morris,
  <i>Old Eng. Miscellany</i>, p. 185 (11 Abusions); Furnivall, <i>Early
  Eng. Poems</i>, Berlin, 1862 (Phil. Soc.), p. 161; "Five Evil Things,"
  Wright and Halliwell, <i>Reliquiae Antiquae</i>, i. 316, and ii. 14.'</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect66" href="#piece24">§ 66. XXIV. <span class="sc">The Court of Love.</span></a></p>

  <p>This piece was first printed by Stowe in 1561. Stowe happened to have
  access to a MS. which was really a miscellaneous collection of
  Middle-English pieces of various dates; and he proceeded to print them as
  being 'certaine workes of Geffray Chauser,' without paying any regard to
  their contents or style. In vol. i. pp. 33, 34, I give a list of his
  additions, numbered 42-60<a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>. By good fortune, the very MS. in
  question is now in Trinity College Library, marked R. 3. 19. We can thus
  tell that he was indebted to it for the pieces numbered 46, 47, 48, 49,
  50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 56, and 59. These eleven pieces are all alike
  remarkable for being non-Chaucerian; indeed, no. 56 is certainly
  Lydgate's. But it has so happened that no. 59, or The Court of Love,
  being the best of these pieces, was on that account 'attributed' to
  Chaucer, whilst the others were unhesitatingly rejected. And it happened
  on this wise.</p>

  <p><a name="sect67">§ 67</a>. After Tyrwhitt had edited the Canterbury
  Tales afresh, it occurred to him to compile a Glossary. He rightly
  reasoned that the Glossary would be strengthened and made more correct if
  he included in it all the harder words found in the <i>whole</i> of
  Chaucer's Works, instead of limiting the vocabulary to words <!-- Page
  lxxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxiii"></a>[lxxiii]</span>which occur in the Canterbury Tales
  only. For this purpose, he proceeded to draw up a List of what he
  conceived to be Chaucer's <i>genuine</i> works; and we must remember that
  the only process open to him was to consider all the old editions, and
  <i>reject</i> such as he conceived to be spurious. Hence his List is not
  really a list of genuine works, but one made by striking out from all
  previous lists the works which he <i>knew</i> to be spurious. A moment's
  reflection will show that this is a very different thing.</p>

  <p>Considering that he had only his own acumen to guide him, and had no
  access to linguistic or grammatical tests, still less to tests derived
  from an examination of rimes or phonology, it is wonderful how well he
  did his work. In the matter of rejection, he did not make a single
  mistake. His first revision was made by considering only the pieces
  numbered 1-41, in the <i>first</i> part of Stowe's print (see vol. i. pp.
  31-33); and he struck out the following, on the express ground that they
  were <i>known to have been written by other authors</i>; viz. nos. 4, 11,
  13, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, and 40<a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Then he went over the list again, and struck out, on internal
  evidence, nos. 15, 18, 21, 22, and 32<a name="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Truly, here was a noble beginning! The only non-Chaucerian pieces
  which he failed to reject explicitly, among nos. 1-41, were the
  following, viz. 6 (A Goodly Balade of Chaucer), 17 (The Complaint of the
  Black Knight), 20 (The Testament of Love), 31 (The Cuckoo and the
  Nightingale), 38 (Go forth, King), and 41 (A Balade in Praise of
  Chaucer). Of course he rejected the last of these, but it was not worth
  his while to say so; and, in the same way, he tacitly rejected or ignored
  nos. 6, 30, and 38. Hence it was that nos. 6, 30, 38, and 41 did not
  appear in Moxon's Chaucer, and even no. 32 was carefully excluded. In his
  final list, out of nos. 1-41, Tyrwhitt actually got rid of all but nos.
  17, 20, and 31 (The Black Knight, The Testament of Love, and The
  Cuckoo).</p>

  <p>As to the remaining articles, he accepted, among the longer pieces,
  nos. 59, 62, and 63, i.e. The Court of Love, Chaucer's Dream, and The
  Flower and the Leaf; to which he added nos. <!-- Page lxxiv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxxiv"></a>[lxxiv]</span>42, 43, and 60 (as
  to which there is no doubt), and also the Virelai (no. 50), on the
  slippery ground that it <i>is</i> a virelai (which, strictly speaking, it
  is not).</p>

  <p><a name="sect68">§ 68</a>. One result of his investigations was that
  an edition of Chaucer was published by Moxon (my copy is dated 1855), in
  which all the poems were included which Tyrwhitt accepted, followed by
  Tyrwhitt's Account of the Works of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>Owing to the popularity of this edition, many scholars accepted the
  poems contained in it as being certainly genuine; but it is obvious that
  this was a very risky thing to do, in the absence of external evidence;
  especially when it is remembered that Tyrwhitt merely wanted to
  illustrate his glossary to the Canterbury Tales by adding words from
  other texts. The idea of drawing up a canon by the process of striking
  out from luxuriant lists the names of pieces that are obviously spurious,
  is one that should never have found acceptance.</p>

  <p><a name="sect69">§ 69</a>. There is only one correct method of drawing
  up a canon of genuine works, viz. that adopted by Mr. Henry Bradshaw,
  formerly our Cambridge University Librarian. It is simple enough, viz. to
  take a clean sheet of paper, and enter upon it, first of all, the names
  of all the pieces that are admittedly genuine; and then to see if it can
  fairly be augmented by adding such pieces as have reasonable evidence in
  their favour. In making a list of this character, The Court of Love has
  no claim to be considered at all, as I fully proved about twenty years
  ago<a name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>; and there is an
  end of the matter. The MS. copy is in a hand of the sixteenth century<a
  name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>, and there is no internal
  evidence to suggest an earlier date.</p>

  <p><a name="sect70">§ 70</a>. Our task is to determine what it really is,
  and what can be made of it as it stands. We learn from the author that he
  <!-- Page lxxv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxv"></a>[lxxv]</span>was 'a clerk of Cambridge' (913), which
  we may readily accept. Beyond this, there is nothing but internal
  evidence; but of this there is much. That our 'clerk' had read Ovid and
  Maximian appears from the Notes; he even seems to have imbibed something
  of 'the new learning,' as he makes up the names Philo-genet and
  Philo-bone by help of a Greek adjective<a name="NtA_39"
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>. Dr. Schick has made it clear that he
  was well acquainted with Lydgate's Temple of Glas, which he imitates
  freely; see Schick's edition of that poem, p. cxxix. Mr. J. T. T. Brown,
  in his criticism on 'The Authorship of the Kingis Quair,' Glasgow, 1896,
  draws many parallels between The Court of Love and The Kingis Quair, and
  concludes that The Kingis Quair was indebted to The Court of Love; but it
  is tolerably certain that the indebtedness was in the other direction.
  For, in The Kingis Quair, some knowledge of the true use of Chaucer's
  final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> is still exhibited, even in a
  Northern poem, whilst in The Court of Love, it is almost altogether dead,
  though the poem is in the Midland dialect. I shall presently shew that
  our clerk, whilst very nearly ignoring the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i>, occasionally employs the final <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i>; but this he does in a way which clearly shews
  that he did not understand when to use it aright, a fact which is highly
  significant.</p>

  <p>I am much indebted to my friend Professor Hales for pointing out
  another very cogent argument. He draws attention to the numerous
  instances in which the author of The Court of Love fails to end a stanza
  with a stop. There is no stop, for example, at the end of ll. 14, 567,
  672, 693, 700, 763, 826, 1064, 1288; and only a slight pause at the end
  of ll. 28, 49, 70, 84, 189, 231, 259, 280, 371, 406, 427, &amp;c. In
  Chaucer's Parlement of Foules, on the other hand, there is but one stanza
  without a stop at the end, viz. at l. 280; and but one with a slight
  pause, viz. at l. 154. The difference between these results is very
  marked, and would convince any mathematician. I should like to add that
  the same test disposes of the claims of The Flower and the Leaf to be
  considered as Chaucer's; it has no stop at the end of ll. 7, 70, 154,
  161, 196, 231, 280, 308, 392, 476, and has mere commas at the end of ll.
  28, 49, 56, 98, 119, 224, 259, 329, 336, &amp;c. In the Assembly of
  Ladies this departure from Chaucer's usage has been <!-- Page lxxvi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxxvi"></a>[lxxvi]</span>nearly
  abandoned, which is one reason why that piece is in a less lively
  style.</p>

  <p><a name="sect71">§ 71</a>. The sole MS. copy of The Court of Love
  belongs to the sixteenth century, and there is nothing to shew that the
  poem itself was of earlier date. Indeed, the language of it is remarkably
  like that of the former half of that century. If it be compared with
  Sackville's famous 'Induction,' the metrical form of the stanzas is much
  the same; there is the same smoothness of rhythm and frequent modernness
  of form, quite different from the halting lines of Lydgate and Hawes.
  This raises a suggestion that the author may have learnt his metre from
  Scottish authors, such as Henryson and Dunbar; and it is surprising to
  find him employing such words as <i>celsitude</i> and <i>pulcritude</i>,
  and even riming them together, precisely as Dunbar did (ll. 611-613, and
  the note). One wonders where he learnt to use such words, if not from
  Scottish authors. Curiously enough, a single instance of the use of a
  Northern inflexion occurs in the phrase <i>me thynkes</i>, 874. And I
  admit the certainty that he consulted The Kingis Quair.</p>

  <p>I have no space to discuss the matter at length; so shall content
  myself with saying that the impression produced upon me is that we have
  here the work of one of the heralds of the Elizabethan poetry, of the
  class to which belonged Nicholas Grimoald, Thomas Sackville, Lord Surrey,
  Lord Vaux, and Sir Francis Bryan. There must have been much fairly good
  poetry in the time of Henry VIII that is lost to us. Tottell's Miscellany
  clearly shews this, as it is a mere selection of short pieces, which very
  nearly perished; but for this fortunate relic, we should not have known
  much about Wyat and Surrey. Sackville, when at Cambridge, acquired some
  distinction for Latin and English verse, but we possess none of it.
  However, Sackville was not the author of The Court of Love, seeing that
  it was published in a 'Chaucer' collection in 1561, long before his
  death.</p>

  <p>The fact that our clerk was well acquainted with so many pieces by
  Chaucer, such as The Knight's Tale, the Complaint of Pity, The Legend of
  Good Women, Troilus, and Anelida, besides giving us reminiscences of The
  Letter of Cupid, and (perhaps) of The Cuckoo and Nightingale, raises the
  suspicion that he had access to Thynne's edition of 1532; and it is quite
  possible that this very book inspired him for his effort. This suspicion
  becomes almost a certainty if it be true that ll. 495-496 <!-- Page

  2819-20; see note at p. <a href="#page545">545</a>. I can find no reason
  for dating the poem earlier than that year.</p>

  <p><a name="sect72">§ 72</a>. However this may be, the chief point to
  notice is that his archaisms are affectations and not natural. He
  frequently dispenses with them altogether for whole stanzas at a time.
  When they occur, they are such as he found in Chaucer abundantly; I refer
  to such phrases as <i>I-wis</i> or <i>y-wis</i>; <i>as blyve</i>; the use
  of <i>ich</i> for <i>I</i> (661); <i>besy cure</i> (36); <i>gan me
  dresse</i> (113; cf. C. T., G 1271); <i>by the feith I shall to god</i>
  (131; cf. Troil. iii. 1649); and many more. He rarely uses the prefix
  <i>i-</i> or <i>y-</i> with the pp.; we find <i>y-born</i> (976),
  <i>y-formed</i> (1176), <i>y-heried</i> (592), <i>y-sped</i> (977), all
  in Chaucer; besides these, I only note <i>y-fed</i> (975),
  <i>y-ravisshed</i> (153), <i>y-stope</i> (281), the last being used in
  the sense of Chaucer's <i>stope</i>. The most remarkable point is the
  almost total absence of the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>; I
  only observe <i>His len-ë body</i> (1257); <i>to serv-e</i> (909); <i>to
  dred-e</i> (603); and <i>in thilk-ë place</i> (642); the last of which is
  a phrase (cf. R. R. 660). On the other hand, whilst thus abstaining from
  the use of the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>, he makes large
  use of the longer and less usual suffix <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i>, which he employs with much skill to heighten
  the archaic effect. Thus we find the past participles <i>holden</i>, 62;
  <i>growen</i>, 182; <i>yoven</i> or <i>yeven</i>, 742; <i>shapen</i>,
  816, 1354; <i>blowen</i>, 1240; the gerunds <i>writen</i>, 35;
  <i>dressen</i>, 179; <i>byden</i>, 321; <i>semen</i>, 607; <i>seken</i>,
  838; <i>worshippen</i>, 1165, and a few others; the infinitives
  <i>maken</i>, 81; <i>byden</i>, 189; <i>quyten</i>, 327, &amp;c., this
  being the commonest use; the present plurals <i>wailen</i>, 256;
  <i>foten</i>, 586; <i>speden</i>, 945, &amp;c.; with the same form for
  the first person, as in <i>wailen</i>, 1113; <i>bleden</i>, 1153; and for
  the second person, as in <i>waxen</i>, 958; <i>slepen</i>, 999.
  Occasionally, this suffix is varied to <i><span class="nw">-yn</span></i>
  or <i><span class="nw">-in</span></i>, as in <i>exilyn</i>, v., 336;
  <i>serchyn</i>, v., 950; <i>spakyn</i>, pt. pl., 624; <i>approchyn</i>,
  pr. pl., 1212. This may be the scribe's doing, and is consistent with
  East Anglian spelling.</p>

  <p>But the artificial character of these endings is startlingly revealed
  when we find <i><span class="nw">-en</span></i> added in an impossible
  position, shewing that its true grammatical use was quite dead. Yet we
  find such examples. A serious error (hardly the scribe's) occurs in l.
  347: 'Wheder that she me <i>helden</i> lefe or loth.' <i>Hold</i> being a
  strong verb, the pt. t. is <i>held</i>; we could however justify the use
  of <i>held-e</i>, by supposing it to be the subjunctive mood, which suits
  the sense; but <i>held-en</i> (with <i><span class="nw">-en</span></i>)
  is the <i>plural</i> form, while <i>she</i> is singular; and really this
  use of <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> in the subjunctive must have
  been long <!-- Page lxxviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxviii"></a>[lxxviii]</span>dead. In l. 684, we have a case
  that is even worse, viz. <i>I kepen in no wyse</i>; here the use of
  <i><span class="nw">-en</span></i> saves a hiatus, but the concord is
  false, like the Latin <i>ego seruamus</i>. In l. 928, the same thing
  recurs, though the scribe has altered <i>greven</i> into <i>growen</i><a
  name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>; for this present tense
  is supposed to agree with <i>I</i>! A very clear case occurs in l. 725:
  <i>For if by me this mater springen out</i>; where the use of <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i>, again meant to save a hiatus, is
  excruciatingly wrong; for <i>mater</i> is singular! This cannot be the
  fault of the scribe. Other examples of false grammar are: <i>thou
  serven</i>, 290; <i>thou sene</i>, 499. But the climax is attained in l.
  526, where we meet with <i>thay kepten ben</i>, where the <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i> is required for the metre. <i>Kepten</i>, as a
  <i>past participle</i>, is quite unique; let us drop a veil over this sad
  lapse, and say no more about it<a name="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>We may, however, fairly notice the constant use of the Northern forms
  <i>their</i> and <i>thaim</i> or <i>theim</i>, where Chaucer has
  <i>hir</i> and <i>hem</i>. The use of <i>their</i> and <i>them</i> (not
  <i>thaim</i>) was well established by the year 1500 in literary English,
  as, e.g., in Hawes and Skelton. Caxton uses all four forms, <i>hem</i>
  and <i>them</i>, <i>her</i> and <i>their</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect73">§ 73</a>. I add a few notes, suggested by an
  examination of the rimes employed.</p>

  <p>The final <i>-e</i> is not used at the end of a line. This is easily
  seen, if carefully looked into. Thus <i>lette</i> (1284) stands for
  <i>let</i>, for it rimes with <i>y-set</i>; <i>grace</i> and
  <i>trespace</i> rime with <i>was</i>, 163; <i>kene</i> rimes with
  <i>bene</i>, misspelling of <i>been</i>, 252; <i>redde</i>, put for
  <i>red</i>, rimes with <i>spred</i>, 302; <i>yerde</i>, put for
  <i>yerd</i>, rimes with <i>aferd</i>, 363; <i>ende</i> rimes with
  <i>frend</i> and <i>fend</i>, 530; and so on throughout<a name="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>. The following assonances occur:
  <i>here</i>, <i>grene</i>, 253; <i>kepe</i>, <i>flete</i>, 309; and the
  following rimes are imperfect: <i>plaint</i>, <i>talent</i>,
  <i>consent</i>, 716; <i>frend</i>, <i>mynd</i>, 1056; <i>nonne</i> (for
  <i>non</i>), <i>boun</i>, 1149; <i>like</i> (<i>i</i> long), <i>stike</i>
  (<i>i</i> short), 673; and perhaps <i>hold</i>, <i>shuld</i><a
  name="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>, 408; <i>hard</i>,
  <i>ferd</i>, 151. <i>Hard</i> is repeated, 149, 151; 1275, 1277. A
  curious rime <!-- Page lxxix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxix"></a>[lxxix]</span>is that of <i>length</i> with
  <i>thynketh</i>, 1059; read <i>thenk'th</i>, and it is good enough.
  Noteworthy are these: <i>thryse</i> (for Chaucer's <i>thry-ës</i>),
  <i>wyse</i>, 537; <i>hens</i> (for Chaucer's <i>henn-ës</i>),
  <i>eloquence</i>, 935; <i>desire</i>, <i>here</i>, 961, 1301; <i>eke</i>,
  <i>like</i>, 561; <i>tretesse</i> (for Chaucer's <i>tretys</i>),
  <i>worthinesse</i>, 28; <i>write</i>, <i>aright</i>, 13; <i>sey</i> (I
  saw), <i>way</i>, 692. In one place, he has <i>discryve</i>, 778, to rime
  with <i>lyve</i>; and in another <i>discry</i> (miswritten
  <i>discryve</i>, 97), to rime with <i>high</i>. As in Chaucer, he
  sometimes has <i>dy</i>, to die, riming with <i>remedy</i>, 340, and
  elsewhere <i>dey</i>, to rime with <i>pray</i>, 582; and again
  <i>fire</i>, <i>fyr</i>, riming with <i>hyre</i>, 883, or with
  <i>desire</i>, 1285, and at another time the Kentish form <i>fere</i>
  (borrowed from Chaucer), with the same sense, r. w. <i>y-fere</i>, 622.
  The most curious forms are those for 'eye.' When it rimes with
  <i>degree</i>, 132, <i>see</i>, 768, we seem to have the Northern form
  <i>ee</i> or <i>e</i>; but elsewhere it rimes with <i>besily</i>, 299,
  <i>pretily</i>, 419, <i>wounderly</i>, 695, <i>dispitously</i>, 1139, or
  with <i>I</i>, 282; and the plural <i>yen</i> (= <i>y'n</i>) rimes with
  <i>lyne</i>, 135. The sounds represented by <i>&#x113;</i> and <i>y</i>
  obviously afford permissible rimes; that the sounds were not identical
  appears from ll. 1051-1055, which end with <i>me</i>, <i>remedy</i>,
  <i>be</i>, <i>dy</i>, <i>company</i> consecutively.</p>

  <p><a name="sect74">§ 74</a>. Perhaps an easier way for enabling a
  learner to recognise the peculiarities of The Court of Love, and the
  difference of its language from Chaucer, is to translate some lines of it
  into Chaucerian English. The effect upon the metre is startling.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  </div>

  <p>Very many more such examples may be given. Or take the following;
  Chaucer has (L. G. W. 476):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For Love ne wól nat countrepleted be.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And this is how it reappears in C. L. 429:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For Love wil not be counterpleted, indede!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here the melody of the line is completely spoilt. <!-- Page lxxx
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxxx"></a>[lxxx]</span></p>

  <p>In the present state of our knowledge of the history of the English
  language, any notion of attributing The Court of Love to Chaucer is worse
  than untenable; for it is wholly disgraceful. Everything points to a very
  late date, and tends to exclude it, not only from the fourteenth, but
  even from the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it will readily be granted that the poem abounds
  with Chaucerian words and phrases to an extent that almost surpasses even
  the poems of Lydgate. The versification is smooth, and the poem, as a
  whole, is pleasing. I have nothing to say against it, when considered on
  its own merits.</p>

  <p><a name="sect75">§ 75</a>. Space fails me to discuss the somewhat
  vexed question of the Courts of Love, of which some have denied the
  existence. However, there seems to be good evidence to shew that they
  arose in Provence, and were due to the extravagances of the troubadours.
  They were travesties of the courts of law, with a lady of rank for a
  judge, and minstrels for advocates; and they discussed subtle questions
  relating to affairs of love, usually between troubadours and ladies. The
  discussions were conducted with much seriousness, and doubtless often
  served to give much amusement to many idle people. Not unfrequently they
  led to tragedies, as is easily understood when we notice that the first
  of one set of thirty-one Laws of Love runs as follows:&mdash;'Marriage
  cannot be pleaded as an excuse for refusing to love.' The reader who
  requires further information is referred to 'The Troubadours and Courts
  of Love,' by J. F. Rowbotham, M.A., London, Swan Sonnenschein and Co.,
  1895.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps necessary to observe that the said Courts have very
  little to do with the present poem, which treats of a Court of Cupid in
  the Chaucerian sense (Leg. Good Women, 352). Even the statutes of the
  Court are largely imitated from Lydgate.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a name="sect76"></a><a href="#piece25">§ 76. <span class="sc">Pieces numbered XXV-XXIX.</span></a></p>

  <p>XXV. <span class="sc">Virelay.</span> This piece, from the Trinity
  MS., belongs to the end of the fifteenth century, and contains no example
  of the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> as constituting a
  syllable. Chaucer would have used <i>sore</i> (l. 2), <i>more</i> (l.
  12), <i>trouth</i> (l. 13), as dissyllables; and he would not have rimed
  <i>pleyn</i> and <i>disdayn</i> with <i>compleyn</i> and <i>absteyn</i>,
  as the two latter require a final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>. The
  rime of <i>finde</i> with <i>ende</i> is extraordinary. <!-- Page lxxxi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelxxxi"></a>[lxxxi]</span></p>

  <p>The title 'Virelai' is given to this piece in Moxon's Chaucer, and is,
  strictly speaking, incorrect; in the MS. and in Stowe's edition, it has
  no title at all! Tyrwhitt cautiously spoke of it as being 'perhaps by
  Chaucer'; and says that 'it comes nearer to the description of a
  <i>Virelay</i>, than anything else of his that has been preserved.' This
  is not the case; see note to Anelida, 256; vol. i. p. 536. Tyrwhitt
  quotes from Cotgrave&mdash;'<i>Virelay</i>, a round, freemen's song,' and
  adds&mdash;'There is a particular description of a <i>Virlai</i>, in the
  <i>Jardin de plaisance</i>, fol. xii, where it makes the <i>decima sexta
  species Rhetorice Gallicane</i>.' For further remarks, see p. 554.</p>

  <p>XXVI. <span class="sc">Prosperity: by John Walton.</span> 'To Mr.
  [Mark] Liddell belongs the honour of the discovery of John Walton as the
  author of the little poem on fol. 119 [of MS. Arch. Seld. B. 24]. The
  lines occur as part of the Prologue (ll. 83-90) to Walton's translation
  of Boethius' <i>De Consolatione</i>.'&mdash;J. T. T. Brown, <i>The
  Authorship of the Kingis Quair</i>, Glasgow, 1896; p. 71. See the account
  of Walton in Warton's Hist. E. Poetry, sect. xx. The original date of the
  stanza was, accordingly, 1410; but we here find it in a late Scottish
  dress. The ascription of it to 'Chaucer,' in the MS., is an obvious
  error; it was written ten years after his death.</p>

  <p>XXVII. <span class="sc">Leaulte vault Richesse.</span> This piece,
  like the former, has no title in the MS.; but the words <i>Leaulte vault
  Richesse</i> (Loyalty deserves riches) occur at the end of it. If the
  original was in a Midland dialect, it must belong to the latter part of
  the fifteenth century. Even in these eight lines we find a contradiction
  to Chaucer's usage; for he always uses <i>lent</i>, pp., as a
  monosyllable, and <i>rent-e</i> as a dissyllable. It is further
  remarkable that he never uses <i>content</i> as an adjective; it first
  appears in Rom. Rose, 5628.</p>

  <p>XXVIII. <span class="sc">Sayings.</span> I give these sayings as
  printed by Caxton; see vol. i. p. 46, where I note that Caxton did not
  ascribe them to Chaucer. They are not at all in his style.</p>

  <p>In MS. Ashmole 59, fol. 78, I find a similar prophecy:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p style="margin-left:1.9em"><i>Prophecia merlini doctoris perfecti.</i></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is extremely interesting to observe the ascription of these lines
  to <i>Merlin</i>; see King Lear, iii. 2. 95.</p>

  <p>XXIX. <span class="sc">Balade.</span> This poor stanza, with its
  long-drawn lines, appears in Stowe at the end of 'Chaucer's Works.' In
  the Trinity MS., it occurs at the end of a copy of The Parlement of
  Foules.</p>

  <p><a name="sect77">§ 77</a>. An examination of the pieces contained in
  the present volume leads us to a somewhat remarkable result, viz. that we
  readily distinguish in them the handiwork of <i>at least</i> twelve
  different authors, of whom no two are much alike, whilst every one of
  them can be distinguished from Chaucer.</p>

  <p>These are: (1) the author of The Testament of Love, who writes in a
  prose style all his own; (2) the author of The Plowmans Tale and Plowmans
  Crede, with his strong powers of invective and love of alliteration,
  whose style could never have been mistaken for Chaucer's in any age<a
  name="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>; (3) the author of Jack
  Upland, with his direct and searching questions; (4) John Gower, with his
  scrupulous regularity of grammatical usages; (5) Thomas Hoccleve, who too
  often accents a dissyllable on the latter syllable when it should be
  accented on the former; (6) Henry Scogan, whose lines are lacking in
  interest and originality; (7) John Lydgate<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>, who allows his verse too many
  licences, so that it cannot always be scanned at the first trial; (8) Sir
  Richard Ros, who writes in English of a quite modern cast, using
  <i>their</i> and <i>them</i> as in modern English, and wholly discarding
  the use of final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> as an inflexion; (9)
  Robert Henryson, who writes smoothly enough and with a fine vein of
  invention, but employs the Northern dialect; (10) Sir Thomas Clanvowe,
  who employs the final <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i> much more
  frequently than Chaucer or even Gower; (11) the authoress of The Flower
  and the Leaf and The Assembly of Ladies, to whom the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i> was an archaism, very convenient for metrical
  embellishment; and (12) the author of The Court of Love, who, while
  discarding <!-- Page lxxxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxxiii"></a>[lxxxiii]</span>the use of the final <i><span
  class="nw">-e</span></i>, was glad to use the final <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i> to save a hiatus or to gain a syllable, and did
  not hesitate to employ it where it was grammatically wrong to do so.</p>

  <p><a name="sect78">§ 78</a>. If the reader were to suppose that this
  exhausts the list, he would be mistaken; for it is quite easy to add at
  least one known name, and to suggest three others. For the piece numbered
  XXVI, on p. 449, has been identified as the work of John Walton, who
  wrote a verse translation of Boethius in the year 1410; whilst it is
  extremely unlikely that no. XXVII, written in Lowland Scottish, was due
  to Henryson, the only writer in that dialect who has been mentioned
  above. This gives a total of <i>fourteen</i> authors already; and I
  believe that we require yet two more before the Virelai and the Sayings
  printed by Caxton (nos. XXV and XXVIII) can be satisfactorily accounted
  for. As for no. XIX&mdash;the Envoy to Alison&mdash;it <i>may</i> be
  Lydgate's, but, on the other hand, it may not. And as for no. XXIX, it is
  of no consequence.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it must be remembered that I here only refer to the selected
  pieces printed in the present volume. If we go further afield, we soon
  find several more authors, all distinct from those above-mentioned, from
  each other, and from Chaucer. I will just instance the author of the Isle
  of Ladies, the authoress (presumably) of The Lamentation of Mary
  Magdalen, the author of The Craft of Lovers, the 'man unknown' who wrote
  The Ten Commandments of Love, and the author of the clumsy lines
  dignified by the title of The Nine Ladies Worthy. It is quite certain
  that <i>not less</i> than twenty authors are represented in the mass of
  heterogeneous material which appears under Chaucer's name in a
  compilation such as that which is printed in the first volume of
  Chalmers' British Poets; which, precisely on that very account, is useful
  enough in its own peculiar way.</p>

  <p><a name="sect79">§ 79</a>. I believe it may be said of nearly every
  piece in the volume, that it now appears in an improved form. In several
  cases, I have collated MSS. that have not previously been examined, and
  have found them to be the best. The Notes are nearly all new; very few
  have been taken from Bell's Chaucer. Several are due to Schick's useful
  notes to The Temple of Glas; and some to Krausser's edition of The Black
  Knight, and to Gröhler's edition of La Belle Dame, both of which reached
  me after my own notes were all in type. I have added a Glossary <!-- Page
  lxxxiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelxxxiv"></a>[lxxxiv]</span>of the harder words; for others, see
  the Glossary already printed in vol. vi.</p>

  <p>In extenuation of faults, I may plead that I have found it much more
  difficult to deal with such heterogenous material as is comprised in the
  present volume than with pieces all written by the same author. The
  style, the grammar, the mode of scansion, the dialect, and even the
  pronunciation are constantly shifting, instead of being reasonably
  consistent, as in the genuine works of Chaucer. Any one who will take the
  pains to observe these points, to compile a sufficient number of notes
  upon difficult passages, and to prepare a somewhat full glossary, may
  thus practically convince himself, as I have done, that not a single
  piece in the present volume ought ever to have been 'attributed' to
  Chaucer. That any of them should have been so attributed&mdash;and some
  of them never were&mdash;has been the result of negligence,
  superficiality, and incapacity, such as (it may be hoped) we have seen
  the last of.</p>

  <p>I wish once more to acknowledge my obligations to Mr. E. B. Nicholson,
  for the loan of his transcript of The Praise of Peace; to Mr. Bradley,
  for his discovery of the authorship of The Testament of Love and for
  other assistance as regards the same; to Dr. E. Krausser, for his edition
  of The Complaint of the Black Knight; to Dr. Gröhler, for his
  dissertation on La Belle Dame sans Mercy; and to Professor Hales for his
  kind help as to some difficult points, and particularly with regard to
  The Court of Love.</p>

      <p>vyces and unresonable lustes, and leveth the kynde course, to</p>
      <p>whiche ende him brought forth his birthe, trewly, he is ungentil,</p>

      <p>ben bad, naughty, and nedy, that wol I prove; wherfore they</p>
      <p>mowe cause no suche thing that is so glorious and good. The</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">15</div></div><p>more richesse thou hast, the more nede hast thou of helpe hem</p>

      <p>ben nedy, that in their having maken thee nedy to helpes, in</p>

      <p>that their cause asketh. Also, every thing hath his being by his</p>

      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">30</div></div><p>vanisshed. And, so, if richesse[s] causen love, and richesse[s]</p>
      <p>weren distroyed, the love shulde vanisshe; but thilke knotte, and</p>
      <p>it be trewe, may not vanisshe, for no going of richesse. <i>Ergo</i>,</p>
      <p>richesse is no cause of the knot. And many men, as I sayd,</p>
      <p>setten the cause of the knotte in richesse; thilke knitten the</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">35</div></div><p>richesse, and nothing the yvel; thilke persons, what-ever they</p>

      <p>and this stant in two thinges, that is, conninge and opinion.</p>

      <p>whiche may nat be of necessitè alone folowinge, thorow necessitè</p>

      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">35</div></div><p>strength of thilke jugement; for thy first wil, that taught thyn</p>
      <p>herte to abyde, and halt it from th'eschaunge, with thy reson</p>
      <p>is accorded. Trewly, this maner of wil thus shal abyde; impossible</p>
      <p>it were to turne, if thy herte be trewe; and if every</p>

      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">40</div></div><p>understande that good wil, knit with reson, but in a false herte</p>
      <p>never is voyded; for power and might of keping this good wil is</p>
      <p>thorow libertè of arbitrement in herte, but good wil to kepe</p>
      <p>may not fayle. Eke than if it fayle, it sheweth it-selfe that good</p>
      <p>wil in keping is not there. And thus false wil, that putteth out</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">45</div></div><p>the good, anon constrayneth the herte to accorde in lovinge of</p>
      <p>thy good wil; and this accordaunce bitwene false wil and thyn</p>

      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">50</div></div><p>Right as ye han in your body dyvers membres, and fyve sondrye</p>

      <p>he useth to wilne; and yet is neyther wil ne reson al the soule;</p>
      <p>but everich of hem is a thing by him-selfe in the soule. And</p>
<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>[130]</span>
      <p>right as everich hath thus singuler instrumentes by hemselfe,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">60</div></div><p>they han as wel dyvers aptes and dyvers maner usinges; and</p>
      <p>thilke aptes mowen in wil ben cleped affeccions. Affeccion is</p>
      <p>an instrument of willinge in his apetytes. Wherfore mokel folk</p>
      <p>sayn, if a resonable creatures soule any thing fervently wilneth,</p>
      <p>affectuously he wilneth; and thus may wil, by terme of equivocas,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">65</div></div><p>in three wayes ben understande. Oon is instrument of willing;</p>
      <p>another is affection of this instrument; and the third is use, that</p>
      <p>setteth it a-werke. Instrument of willing is thilke strength of the</p>
      <p>soule, which that constrayneth to wilne, right as reson is instrument</p>
      <p>of resons, which ye usen whan ye loken. Affeccion of this</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">70</div></div><p>instrument is a thing, by whiche ye be drawe desyrously any-thing</p>
      <p>to wilne in coveitous maner, al be it for the tyme out</p>
      <p>of your mynde; as, if it come in your thought thilke thing to</p>
      <p>remembre, anon ye ben willing thilke to done or els to have.</p>
      <p>And thus is instrument wil; and affeccion is wil also, to wilne</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">75</div></div><p>thing as I said; as, for to wilne helth, whan wil nothing theron</p>
      <p>thinketh; for anon as it cometh to memorie, it is in wil. And so</p>
      <p>is affeccion to wilne slepe, whan it is out of mynde; but anon</p>
      <p>as it is remembred, wil wilneth slepe, whan his tyme cometh of</p>
      <p>the doinge. For affeccion of wil never accordeth to sicknesse,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">80</div></div><p>ne alway to wake. Right so, in a true lovers affeccion of willing,</p>
      <p>instrument is to wilne tr[o]uthe in his service; and this affeccion</p>
      <p>alway abydeth, although he be sleping or thretned, or els not</p>
      <p>theron thinking; but anon as it cometh to mynde, anon he is</p>
      <p>stedfast in that wil to abyde. Use of this instrument forsothe</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">85</div></div><p>is another thing by himselfe; and that have ye not but whan</p>
      <p>ye be doing in willed thing, by affect or instrument of wil</p>
      <p>purposed or desyred; and this maner of usage in my service</p>
      <p>wysely nedeth to be ruled from wayters with envy closed, from</p>
      <p>spekers ful of jangeling wordes, from proude folk and hautayn,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">90</div></div><p>that lambes and innocentes bothe scornen and dispysen. Thus</p>
      <p>in doing varieth the actes of willinge everich from other, and yet</p>
      <p>ben they cleped "wil," and the name of wil utterly owen they to</p>
      <p>have; as instrument of wil is wil, whan ye turne in-to purpos of</p>
      <p>any thing to don, be it to sitte or to stande, or any such thing</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">95</div></div><p>els. This instrument may ben had, although affect and usage be</p>
      <p>left out of doing; right as ye have sight and reson, and yet alway</p>
<!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>[131]</span>
      <p>use ye* &dagger;nat to loke, [ne] thinges with resonning to prove; and so</p>
      <p>is instrument of wil, wil; and yet varyeth he from effect and</p>
      <p>using bothe. Affeccion of wil also for wil is cleped, but it varyeth</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">100</div></div><p>from instrument in this maner wyse, by that nameliche, whan it</p>
      <p>cometh in-to mynde, anon-right it is in willinge desyred, and the</p>
      <p>negatif therof with willing nil not acorde; this is closed in herte,</p>
      <p>though usage and instrument slepe. This slepeth whan instrument</p>
      <p>and us[e] waken; and of suche maner affeccion, trewly,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">105</div></div><p>some man hath more and some man lesse. Certes, trewe lovers</p>
      <p>wenen ever therof to litel to have. False lovers in litel wenen</p>
      <p>have right mokel. Lo, instrument of wil in false and trewe</p>
      <p>bothe, evenliche is proporcioned; but affeccion is more in some</p>
      <p>places than in some, bycause of the goodnesse that foloweth, and</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">110</div></div><p>that I thinke hereafter to declare. Use of this instrument is wil,</p>
      <p>but it taketh his name whan wilned thing is in doing; but utterly</p>
      <p>grace to cacche in thy blisse &dagger;desyreth to ben rewarded. Thou</p>
      <p>most have than affeccion of wil at the ful, and use whan his</p>
      <p>tyme asketh wysely to ben governed. Sothly, my disciple,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">115</div></div><p>without fervent affeccion of wil may no man ben saved. This</p>
      <p>affeccion of good service in good love may not ben grounded,</p>
      <p>without fervent desyr to the thing in wil coveited. But he that</p>
      <p>never reccheth to have or not to have, affeccion of wil in that</p>
      <p>hath no resting-place. Why? For whan thing cometh to mynde,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">120</div></div><p>and it be not taken in hede to comin or not come, therfore in</p>
      <p>that place affeccion fayleth; and, for thilke affeccion is so litel,</p>
      <p>thorow whiche in goodnesse he shulde come to his grace, the</p>
      <p>litelnesse wil it not suffre to avayle by no way in-to his helpes.</p>
      <p>Certes, grace and reson thilke affeccion foloweth. This affeccion,</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">125</div></div><p>with reson knit, dureth in everiche trewe herte, and evermore</p>
      <p>is encresing; no ferdnesse, no strength may it remove, whyle</p>
      <p>tr[o]uthe in herte abydeth. Sothly, whan falsheed ginneth entre,</p>
      <p>tr[o]uthe draweth away grace and joye bothe; but than thilke</p>

<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span>
      <p>and that is unreson. Lo, than, wil and unreson bringeth a man</p>
      <p>from the blisse of grace; whiche thing, of pure kynde, every man</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">135</div></div><p>ought to shonne and to eschewe, and to the knot of wil and reson</p>

      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">20</div></div><p>thorow grace of this Margarite-perle. It is no maner doute, that</p>

<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[138]</span>
      <p>for it is rightful it-selve. Also wil is not lovinge for he wol love;</p>
      <p>but he wol love for he is lovinge; it is al oon to &dagger;wilne to be</p>
      <p>lovinge, and lovinges in possession to have. Right so wil wol not</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">25</div></div><p>love, for of love hath he no partie. And yet I denye not lovinge</p>
      <p>wil [may] wilne more love to have, whiche that he hath not whan</p>
      <p>he wolde more than he hath; but I saye, he may no love wilne</p>
      <p>if he no love have, through which thilke love he shuld wilne. But</p>
      <p>to have this loving wil may no man of him-selfe, but only through</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">30</div></div><p>grace toforn-going; right so may no man it kepe, but by grace</p>
      <p>folowinge. Consider now every man aright, and let seen if that</p>
      <p>any wight of him-selfe mowe this loving wel gete, and he therof</p>
      <p>first nothing have; for if it shulde of him-selfe springe, either it</p>
      <p>muste be willing or not willing. Willing by him-selfe may he it not</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">35</div></div><p>have, sithen him fayleth the mater that shulde it forth bringe.</p>
      <p>The mater him fayleth; why? He may therof have no knowing</p>
      <p>til whan grace put it in his herte. Thus willing by him-selfe may</p>
      <p>he it not have; and not willing, may he it not have. Pardè,</p>
      <p>every conseyt of every resonable creature otherwyse wil [wol] not</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">40</div></div><p>graunte; wil in affirmatif with not willing by no way mowe acorde.</p>
      <p>And although this loving wol come in myn herte by freenesse of</p>
      <p>arbitrement, as in this booke fully is shewed, yet owe I not therfore</p>
      <p>as moche alowe my free wil as grace of that Margaryte to me</p>
      <p>lened. For neyther might I, without grace to-forn going and</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">45</div></div><p>afterward folowing, thilke grace gete ne kepe; and lese shal I it</p>
      <p>never but-if free wil it make, as in willinge otherwyse than grace</p>
      <p>hath me graunted. For right as whan any person taketh willing</p>
      <p>to be sobre, and throweth that away, willing to be dronke; or els</p>
      <p>taketh wil of drinking out of mesure; whiche thing, anon as it is</p>

      <p>his grace. In whiche thing therfore upon the nobley of grace</p>
      <p>I mote trusten, and my besy cure sette thilke grace to kepe, that</p>
      <p>my free wil, otherwyse than by reson it shulde werche, cause not</p>

      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">55</div></div><p>grace. For right as naturel usage in engendring of children may</p>
      <p>not ben without &dagger;fader, ne also but with the &dagger;moder, for neyther</p>
      <p>&dagger;fader ne &dagger;moder in begetting may it lacke; right so grace and</p>

      <p>free wil accorden, and withoute hem bothe may not lovinge wil in</p>

      <p>whiche a man shal be saved (of whiche thing al this book mencion</p>

      <p>rightful is behoten the blisse everlastinge, but to hem that ben</p>
      <p>rightful withouten any unrightfulnesse. Some man after some degree</p>
      <p>may rightfully ben accompted as chaste men in living, and yet ben</p>
      <p>they janglers and ful of envy pressed; to hem shal this blisse</p>
      <div class="x1"><div class="linenumr" style="width:32.5em;">80</div></div><p>never ben delivered. For right as very blisse is without al maner</p>
      <p>nede, right so to no man shal it be yeven but to the rightful, voyde</p>
      <p>from al maner unrightfulnesse founde; so no man to her blisse</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece1">I. THE TESTAMENT OF LOVE.</a></p>

  <p>The text is from Thynne's first edition (1532); the later reprints are
  of inferior value. No MS. of this piece is known. Rejected spellings are
  given at the bottom of each page. Conjectural emendations are marked by a
  prefixed obelus (&dagger;). In many places, words or letters are
  supplied, within square brackets, to complete or improve the sense. For
  further discussion of this piece, see the Introduction.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Book I.</span></p>

  <p><b>Prologue.</b> 1. The initial letters of the chapters in Book I.
  form the words <span class="sm">MARGARETE OF</span>. See the
  Introduction.</p>

  <p>3. <i>by queynt knitting coloures</i>, by curious fine phrases, that
  'knit' or join the words or verses together. For <i>colours</i> = fine
  phrases, cf. Ch., HF. 859; C. T., E 16, F 726.</p>

  <p>7. <i>for</i>, because, seeing that; <i>boystous</i>, rough, plain,
  unadorned; cf. l. 12. The Glossary in vol. vi should be compared for
  further illustration of the more difficult words.</p>

  <p>19. <i>for the first leudnesse</i>, on account of the former lack of
  skill.</p>

  <p>21. <i>yeve sight</i>, enable men to see clearly.</p>

  <p>30. <i>conne jumpere suche termes</i>, know how to jumble such terms
  together. <i>Jumpere</i> should rather be spelt <i>jumpre</i>; cf.
  <i>jompre</i> in the Gloss. to Chaucer. For such words, see the Glossary
  appended to the present volume.</p>

  <p><i>but as</i>, except as the jay chatters English; i.e. without
  understanding it; cf. Ch. Prol. 642.</p>

  <p>43. <i>necessaries to cacche</i>, to lay hold of necessary ideas.
  Throughout this treatise, we frequently find the verb placed <i>after</i>
  the substantive which it governs, or relegated to the end of the clause
  or sentence. This absurd affectation often greatly obscures the
  sense.</p>

  <p>45. The insertion of the words <i>perfeccion is</i> is absolutely
  necessary to the sense; cf. ll. 47, 50. For the general argument, cf. Ch.
  Boeth. iii. <!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page452"></a>[452]</span>proses 10 and 11, where 'perfection' is
  represented by <i>suffisaunce</i>, as, e.g., in iii. pr. 11. l. 18.</p>

  <p>50. Aristotle's Metaphysics begins with the words: <span title="pantes anthrôpoi tou eidenai oregontai phusei" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1F71;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F04;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&iota; &tau;&omicron;&#x1FE6;
  &#x1F10;&iota;&delta;&#x1F73;&nu;&alpha;&iota;
  &#x1F40;&rho;&#x1F73;&gamma;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
  &phi;&#x1F7B;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;</span>, all men by nature are
  actuated by the desire of knowledge. The reference to this passage is
  explicitly given in the Romans of Partenay, ll. 78-87; and it was
  doubtless a much worn quotation. And see l. 64 below.</p>

  <p>58. <i>sightful and knowing</i>, visible and capable of being
  known.</p>

  <p>61. <i>David</i>. The whole of this sentence is so hopelessly corrupt
  that I can but give it up. Possibly there is a reference to Ps. cxxxix.
  14. <i>me in makinge</i> may be put for 'in makinge me.' <i>Tune</i> is
  probably a misprint for <i>time</i>; <i>lent</i> may be an error for
  <i>sent</i>; but the whole is hopelessly wrong.</p>

  <p>64. Apparently derived from Aristotle, De Animalibus, bk. i. c. 5. The
  general sense is that created things like to know both their creator and
  the causes of natural things akin to them (<span title="oikeia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&alpha;</span>).</p>

  <p>67. <i>Considred</i>; i.e. the forms of natural things and their
  creation being considered, men should have a great natural love to the
  Workman that made them.</p>

  <p>68. <i>me</i> is frequently written for <i>men</i>, the unemphatic
  form of <i>man</i>, in the impersonal sense of 'one' or 'people'; thus,
  in King Horn, ed. Morris, 366, 'ne recche i what <i>me</i> telle' means
  'I care not what people may say.' Strict grammar requires the form
  <i>him</i> for <i>hem</i> in l. 69, as <i>me</i> is properly singular;
  but the use of <i>hem</i> is natural enough in this passage, as <i>me</i>
  really signifies created beings in general. Cf. <i>me</i> in ch. i. l. 18

  <p>80. <i>Styx</i> is not 'a pit,' but a river. The error is Chaucer's;
  cf. 'Stix, the put of helle,' in Troil. iv. 1540. Observe the
  expression&mdash;'Stygiamque paludem'; Vergil, Aen. vi. 323.</p>

  <p>86. I. e. 'rend the sword out of the hands of Hercules, and set
  Hercules' pillars at Gades a mile further onward.' For the latter
  allusion, see Ch. vol. ii. p. lv; it may have been taken from Guido delle
  Colonne. And see Poem VIII (below), l. 349. <i>Gades</i>, now Cadiz.</p>

  <p>89. <i>the spere</i>, the spear. There seems to be some confusion
  here. It was King Arthur who drew the magic sword out of the stone, after
  150 knights had failed in the attempt: see Merlin, ed. Wheatley (E. E. T.
  S.), pp. 100-3. Alexander's task was to untie the Gordian knot.</p>

  <p>90. <i>And that</i>; 'and who says that, surpassing all wonders, he
  will be master of France by might, whereas even King Edward III could not
  conquer all of it.' An interesting allusion.</p>

  <p>96. <i>unconninge</i>, ignorance. There is an unpublished treatise
  called 'The Cloud of Unknowing'; but it is probably not here alluded
  to.</p>

  <p>98. <i>gadered</i>, gathered. Thynne almost invariably commits the
  anachronism of spelling the words <i>gader</i>, <i>fader</i>,
  <i>moder</i>, <i>togider</i>, and the like, with <i>th</i>; and I have
  usually set him right, marking such corrections with a prefixed obelus
  (&dagger;). Cf. <i>weder</i> in l. 123 below.</p>

  <p>100. <i>rekes</i>, ricks. The idea is from Chaucer, L. G. W. 73-4.
  <!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page453"></a>[453]</span></p>

  <p>101, 102. <i>his reson</i>, the reason of him. <i>hayne</i>,
  hatred.</p>

  <p>110. <i>Boëce</i>, Boethius. No doubt the author simply consulted
  Chaucer's translation. See the Introduction.</p>

  <p>115. <i>slye</i>, cunning; evidently alluding to the parable of the
  unjust steward.</p>

  <p>117. <i>Aristotle</i>. The allusion appears to be to the Nicomachean
  Ethics, bk. i. c. 7: <span title="doxeie d' an pantos einai proagagein, ... pantos gar prostheinai to elleipon" class="grk"

  <p>122. <i>betiden</i>, happened to me; the <i>i</i> is short. This
  sudden transition to the mention of the author's pilgrimage suggests that
  a portion of the Prologue is missing here.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. I.</b> 1. Copied from Ch. Boeth. bk. i. met. 1. ll. 1, 2.</p>

  <p>12. <i>thing</i> seems to mean 'person'; the person that cannot now
  embrace me when I wish for comfort.</p>

  <p>15. <i>prison</i>; probably not a material prison. The author, in
  imitation of Boethius, imagines himself to be imprisoned. At p. 144, l.
  132, he is 'in good plite,' i.e. well off. Cf. note to ch. iii. 116.</p>

  <p>16. <i>caitived</i>, kept as a captive; the correction of
  <i>caytisned</i> (with &#x17F; for <i>s</i>) to <i>caytifued</i> (better
  spelt <i>caitived</i>) is obvious, and is given in the New E. Dict., s.v.
  <i>Caitive</i>.</p>

  <p>17, 18. <i>Straunge</i>, a strange one, some stranger; <i>me</i>, one,
  really meaning 'myself'; <i>he shulde</i>, it ought to be.</p>

  <p>21, 22. <i>bewent</i>, turned aside; see New E. Dict., s.v.
  <i>Bewend</i>. The reading <i>bewet</i>, i.e. profusely wetted, occurs
  (by misprinting) in later editions, and is adopted in the New E. Dict,
  s.v. <i>Bewet</i>. It is obviously wrong.</p>

  <p>23. <i>of hem</i>, by them; these words, in the construction, follow
  <i>enlumined</i>. The very frequent inversion of phrases in this piece
  tends greatly to obscure the sense of it.</p>

  <p>24. <i>Margarite precious</i>, a precious pearl. Gems were formerly
  credited with 'virtues'; thus Philip de Thaun, in his Bestiary (ed.
  Wright, l. 1503), says of the pearl&mdash;</p>

  <p>'A mult choses pot valier, ki cestes peres pot aveir,' &amp;c., or, in
  Wright's translation: 'For him who can have this stone, it will be of
  force against many things; there will never be any infirmity, except
  death, from which a person will not come to health, who will drink it
  with dew, if he has true faith.' See l. 133 below.</p>

  <p>28. <i>twinkling in your disese</i>, a small matter tending to your
  discomfort. Here <i>disese</i> = dis-ease, want of ease. Cf. l. 31
  below.</p>

  <p>42. 'It is so high,' &amp;c. The implied subject to which <i>it</i>
  refers is <i>paradise</i>, where the author's <i>Eve</i> is supposed to
  be. Hence the sense is:&mdash;'paradise is so far away from the place
  where I am lying and from the common earth, that no cable (let down from
  it) can reach me.'</p>

  <p>59. <i>ferdnes</i> is obviously the right word, though misprinted
  <i>frendes</i>. It signifies 'fear,' and occurs again in ch. ii. ll. 9,
  16; besides, it is again misprinted as <i>frendes</i> in the same
  chapter, l. 13.</p>

  <p>63. <i>weyved</i> is an obvious correction for <i>veyned</i>; see the
  Glossary. <!-- Page 454 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page454"></a>[454]</span></p>

  <p>70. <i>mercy passeth right</i>, your mercy exceeds your justice. This
  was a proverbial phrase, or, as it is called in the next clause, a
  'proposition.'</p>

  <p>79. <i>flitte</i>, stir, be moved; 'not even the least bit.'</p>

  <p>80. <i>souded</i> (misprinted <i>sonded</i> by Thynne), fixed; cf. Ch.
  C.T., B 1769. From O.F. <i>souder</i>, Lat. <i>solidare</i>.</p>

  <p>83. <i>do</i>, cause; 'cause the lucky throw of comfort to fall
  upward'; alluding to dice-play.</p>

  <p>96. <i>wolde conne</i>, would like to be able to.</p>

  <p>99, 100. <i>me weninge</i>, when I was expecting. <i>ther-as</i>,
  whereas.</p>

  <p>116. <i>no force</i>, it does not matter; no matter for that.</p>

  <p>117-20. Evidently corrupt, even when we read <i>flowing</i> for
  <i>folowing</i>, and <i>of al</i> for <i>by al</i>. Perhaps <i>ther</i>
  in l. 119 should be <i>they</i>; giving the sense:&mdash;'but they (thy
  virtues) are wonderful, I know not which (of them it is) that prevents
  the flood,' &amp;c. Even so, a clause is lacking after <i>vertues</i> in
  l. 118.</p>

  <p>126. Thynne has <i>ioleynynge</i> for <i>ioleyuynge</i>, i.e.
  <i>joleyving</i>, cheering, making joyous. The word is riot given in
  Stratmann or in Mätzner, but Godefroy has the corresponding O.F. verb
  <i>joliver</i>, to caress.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. II.</b> 18. <i>a lady</i>; this is evidently copied from
  Boethius; see Ch. Boeth. bk. i. pr. 1. l. 3. The visitor to the prison of
  Boethius was named Philosophy; the visitor in the present case is Love,
  personified as a female; see l. 53 below.</p>

  <p>20. <i>blustringe</i>, glance. But the word is not known in this
  sense, and there is evidently some mistake here. I have no doubt that the
  right word is <i>blushinge</i>; for the M.E. <i>blusshen</i> was often
  used in the sense of 'to cast a glance, give a look, glance with the
  eye'; as duly noted in the New E. Dict, s.v. <i>Blush</i>. The word was
  probably written <i>bluschinge</i> in Thynne's MS., with a <i>c</i>
  exactly (as often) like a <i>t</i>. If he misread it as
  <i>blusthinge</i>, he may easily have altered it to
  <i>blustringe</i>.</p>

  <p>32. <i>neighe</i>, approach; governing <i>me</i>.</p>

  <p>37. <i>O my nory</i>, O my pupil! Copied from Ch. Boeth. bk. i. pr. 3.
  l. 10; cf. the same, bk. iii. pr. 11. l. 160. In l. 51 below, we have
  <i>my disciple</i>.</p>

  <p>60. <i>by thyn owne vyse</i>, by thine own resolve; i.e. of thine own
  accord; see <i>Advice</i> in the New E. Dict. § 6. <i>Vyse</i> is put for
  <i>avyse</i>, the syllable <i>a</i> being dropped. Halliwell notes that
  <i>vice</i>, with the sense of 'advice,' is still in use.</p>

  <p>64. 'Because it comforts me to think on past gladness, it (also) vexes
  me again to be doing so.' Clumsily expressed; and borrowed from Ch.
  Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 4. ll. 4-7.</p>

  <p>74-84. From Matt. xviii. 12; Luke, xv. 4; John, x. 11.</p>

  <p>92. Love was kind to Paris, because he succeeded in gaining Helen.
  Jason was false to Love, because he deserted Hypsipyle and Medea. It is
  probable that <i>false</i> is misprinted for <i>faire</i> in l. 93;
  otherwise there is no contrast, as is implied by <i>for</i>.</p>

  <p>93. <i>Sesars sonke</i> (<i>sic</i>) should probably be <i>Cesars
  swink</i>, i.e. Caesar's toil. I adopt this reading to make sense; but it
  is not at all clear why Caesar should have been selected as the type of a
  successful lover. <!-- Page 455 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page455"></a>[455]</span></p>

  <p>95. <i>loveday</i>, a day of reconciliation; see note to Ch. C. T., A
  258.</p>

  <p>96. 'And chose a maid to be umpire between God and man'; alluding to
  the Virgin Mary.</p>

  <p>114-5. <i>cause, causing</i>, the primary cause, originating these
  things and many others besides. See note to Troil. iv. 829.</p>

  <p>123-4. <i>wo is him</i>; Lat. ve soli, Eccl. iv. 10; quoted in Troil.
  i. 694.</p>

  <p>125. Cf. 'weep with them that weep'; Rom. xii. 15.</p>

  <p>138. Here the author bemoans his losses and heavy expenses.</p>

  <p>143. For <i>wolde endeynous</i> I here read <i>wolde ben deynous</i>,
  i.e. would be disdainful; see <i>Deynous</i> in the Gloss. to Chaucer.
  The New E. Dict. adopts the reading <i>wolde [be] endeynous</i>, with the
  same sense; but no other example of the adj. <i>endeynous</i> is known,
  and it is an awkward formation. However, there are five examples of the
  verb <i>endeign</i>, meaning 'to be indignant'; see Wyclif, Gen. xviii.
  30; Ex. xxxii. 22; Is. lvii. 6; Job, xxxii. 2; Wisd. xii. 27.</p>

  </div>

  <p>See the note on the latter line.</p>

  <p><i>Wethercocke</i> is a late spelling; the proper M.E. spelling is
  <i>wedercokke</i>, from a nom. <i>wedercok</i>, which appears in the poem
  Against Women Unconstant, l. 12.</p>

  <p>173. <i>a</i>, an unemphatic form of <i>have</i>; 'thou wouldest have
  made me.'</p>

  <p>180. <i>voyde</i>, do away with. <i>webbes</i>; the <i>web</i>, also
  called <i>the pin and web</i>, or <i>the web and pin</i>, is a disease of
  the eyes, now known as cataract. See Nares, s.v. <i>Pin</i>; Florio's
  Ital. Dict., s.v. <i>Cateratta</i>; the New E. Dict., s.v.
  <i>Cataract</i>; King Lear, iii. 4. 122; Winter's Tale, i. 2. 291.</p>

  <p>191, 192. <i>truste on Mars</i>, trust to Mars, i.e. be ready with
  wager of battle; alluding to the common practice of appealing to arms
  when a speaker's truthfulness was called in question. See ch. vii. 10
  below (p. 31).</p>

  <p><b>Chap. III.</b> 14. <i>Come of</i>, lit. come off; but it is
  remarkable that this phrase is used in M.E. where we should now say
  rather 'come on!' See note to Troil. ii. 1738.</p>

  <p>21. <i>mayst thou</i>, canst thou do (or act)?</p>

  <p>25-7. 'I never yet set any one to serve anywhere who did not succeed
  in his service.'</p>

  <p>32. 'the nut in every nook.' Perhaps <i>on</i> should be
  <i>in</i>.</p>

  <p>37-8. There is some corruption here. I insert <i>Tho gan I</i> to help
  out the sense, but it remains partially obscure. Perhaps the sense
  is:&mdash;'Often one does what one does not wish to do, being stirred to
  do so by the opinion of others, who wanted me to stay at home; whereupon
  I suddenly began to wish to travel.' He would rather have stayed at home;
  but when he found that others wanted him to do so, he perversely began to
  wish to travel.</p>

  <p>39. <i>the wynding of the erthe</i>; an obscure expression; perhaps
  'the envelopment of the earth in snow.' <!-- Page 456 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page456"></a>[456]</span></p>

  <p>40. 'I walked through woods in which were broad ways, and (then) by
  small paths which the swine had made, being lanes with by-paths for
  seeking (there) their beech-mast.'</p>

  <p>42. <i>ladels</i>, by-paths (?). No other example of the word appears.
  I guess it to be a diminutive of M.E. <i>lade</i>, a path, road, which
  occurs in the Ormulum; see Stratmann. Perhaps it is a mere misprint for
  <i>lades</i>.</p>

  <p>44, 45. <i>gonne to wilde</i>, began to grow wild; cf. <i>ginne ayen
  waxe ramage</i>, in l. 48, with the like sense. I know of no other
  example of the verb <i>to wilde</i>.</p>

  <p>52. <i>shippe</i>, ship; not, however, a real ship, but an allegorical
  one named Travail, i.e. Danger; see ll. 55, 75 below. <i>many</i> is here
  used in place of <i>meynee</i>, referring to the ship's company; some of
  whom had the allegorical names of Sight, Lust, Thought, and Will. The
  'ship' is a common symbol of this present life, in which we are
  surrounded by perils; compare the parable of 'the wagging boat' in P.
  Plowm. C. xi. 32, and the long note to that line.</p>

  <p>58. <i>old hate</i>; probably borrowed from Ch. Pers. Tale, I 562; see
  the note.</p>

  <p>64. <i>avowing</i>, vowing; because persons in peril used to vow to
  perform pilgrimages.</p>

  <p>75. <i>my ship was out of mynde</i>, i.e. I forgot all about my
  previous danger.</p>

  <p>84. <i>the man</i>, the merchant-man in Matt. xiii. 45.</p>

  <p>105. <i>enmoysed</i>, comforted. <i>Enmoise</i> or <i>emmoise</i> is a
  variant of M.E. <i>amese</i>, <i>ameise</i>, from O.F. <i>amaiser</i>,
  <i>amaisier</i>, to pacify, appease, render gentle (Godefroy); answering
  to the Low Lat. type <i>*ad-mitiare</i> from <i>mitis</i>, gentle. See
  <i>Amese</i> in the New E. Dict. No other example of the form
  <i>enmoyse</i> is known.</p>

  <p>111. <i>of nothing now may serve</i>, is now of no use (to you).</p>

  <p>116. <i>prison</i>; the author has forgotten all about his adventure
  in the ship, and is now back in prison, as in ch. i.</p>

  <p>118. <i>renyant forjuged</i>, a denier (of his guilt) who has been
  wrongfully condemned.</p>

  <p>121. <i>suche grace and non hap</i>, such favour and no mere luck.</p>

  <p>124. <i>let-games</i>; probably from Troil. iii. 527; spoilers of
  sport or happiness. <i>wayters</i>, watchers, watch-men, guards.</p>

  <p>131. <i>nothing as ye shulde</i>, not at all as you ought to do.</p>

  <p>148. <i>feld</i>, felled, put down, done away with.</p>

  <p>153-4. <i>For he ... suffer</i>, a perfect alliterative line; imitated
  from P. Plowm. C. xxi. 212:&mdash;'For wot no wight what wele is, that
  never wo suffrede.' Clearly quoted from memory; cf. notes to bk. ii. ch.
  9. 178, and ch. 13. 86.</p>

  <p>157. <i>happy hevinesse</i>, fortunate grief; a parallel expression to
  <i>lyking tene</i>, i.e. pleasing vexation, in l. 158. These
  contradictory phrases were much affected by way of rhetorical flourish.
  For a long passage of this character, cf. Rom. Rose, 4703-50.</p>

  <p>158. <i>harse</i> is almost certainly a misprint for <i>harme</i>;
  then <i>goodly</i> <!-- Page 457 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page457"></a>[457]</span><i>harme</i> means much the same as
  <i>lyking tene</i> (see note above). So, in Rom. Rose, 4710, 4733, 4743,
  we find mention of 'a sweet peril,' 'a joyous pain,' and 'a sweet
  hell.'</p>

  <p><b>Chap. IV.</b> 2. <i>semed they boren</i>, they seemed to bore;
  <i>boren</i> being in the infin. mood.</p>

  <p>18. For <i>or</i> read <i>for</i>, to make sense; <i>for of
  disese</i>, for out of such distress come gladness and joy, so poured out
  by means of a full vessel, that such gladness quenches the feeling of
  former sorrows. Here <i>gladnesse and joy</i> is spoken of as being all
  one thing, governing the singular verb <i>is</i>, and being alluded to as
  <i>it</i>.</p>

  <p>25. <i>commensal</i>, table-companion; from F. <i>commensal</i>, given
  in Cotgrave. See the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>27. <i>soukinges</i>, suckings, draughts of milk; cf. Ch. Boeth. bk.
  i. pr. 2. l. 4.</p>

  <p>36. <i>clothe</i>, cloth. This circumstance is copied from Ch. Boeth.
  bk. i. pr. 2. l. 19.</p>

  <p>42. This reference to Love, as controlling the universe, is borrowed
  from Boeth. bk. ii. met. 8.</p>

  <p>47. Read <i>werne</i> (refuse) and <i>wol</i> (will); 'yet all things
  desire that you should refuse help to no one who is willing to do as you
  direct him.'</p>

  <p>56. <i>every thing in coming</i>, every future thing.
  <i>contingent</i>, of uncertain occurrence; the earliest known quotation
  for this use of the word in English.</p>

  <p>61-2. <i>many let-games</i>; repeated from above, ch. iii. ll. 124-8.
  <i>thy moeble</i>; from the same, ll. 131-2.</p>

  <p>64. <i>by the first</i>, with reference to your first question; so
  also <i>by that other</i>, with reference to your second question, in l.

  <p><b>Chap. V.</b> 8. Acrisius shut his daughter Danaë up in a tower, to

  <p>14. <i>entremellen</i>, intermingle hearts after merely seeing each
  other.</p>

  equivalent to <i>living people</i> in ll. 17, 18.</p>

  964.</p>

  the number of workdays is <i>seven</i>; and that, in Christian countries,
  the day of rest is the eighth day in the week! <i>kinrest</i>, rest for

  example of this somewhat clumsy compound.</p>

  <p>110. <i>sothed</i>, verified; referring to Luke, xiv. 29.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. VI.</b> 3. <i>enfame</i>, infamy, obloquy; from Lat.
  <i>infamia</i>. Godefroy gives <i>enfamer</i>, to dishonour. The word
  only occurs in the present treatise; see ll. 6, 7, 15.</p>

  <p>12. From Prov. xxvii. 6: 'Meliora sunt vulnera diligentis quam
  fraudulenta oscula odientis.'</p>

  <p>17. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 6. ll. 5-13.</p>

  <p>23. Cf. the same; bk. iv. pr. 7. ll. 34-42.</p>

  <p>27. Cf. the same; bk. ii. pr. 5. ll. 121, 122.</p>

  <p>30. Cf. the same; bk. iv. pr. 6. ll. 184-191.</p>

  <p>48. <i>Zedeoreys</i> (or <i>&#x21D;edeoreys</i>). I can find nothing
  resembling this strange name, nor any trace of its owner's dealings with
  Hannibal.</p>

  <p>53. The (possibly imaginary) autobiographical details here supplied
  have been strangely handled for the purpose of insertion into the life of
  Chaucer, with which they have nothing to do. See Morris's Chaucer, vol.
  i. p. 32 (Aldine edition). The author tells us very little, except that
  tumults took place in London, of which he was a native, and that he had
  knowledge of some secret which he was pressed to betray, and did so in
  order to serve his own purposes. <!-- Page 459 --><span

  <p>77-8. From Chaucer, Troil. v. 6, 7:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>107. Referring to John, xiv. 27.</p>

  <p>114. <i>Athenes</i>; Athene was the goddess who maintained the
  authority of law and order, and in this sense was 'a god of peace.' But
  she was certainly also a goddess of battles.</p>

  <p>139. <i>mighty senatoures</i>. It has been conjectured that the
  reference is to John of Gaunt. In the Annals of England, under the date
  1384, it is noted that 'John of Northampton, a vehement partisan of the
  duke, is tried and sentenced to imprisonment and forfeiture. An attempt
  is also made to put the duke on his trial.' John of Northampton had been
  mayor of London in 1382, when there was a dispute between the court and
  the citizens regarding his election; perhaps the words <i>comen
  eleccion</i> (common election), in l. 125 above, may refer to this
  trouble; so also <i>free eleccion</i> in l. 140. In l. 143 we must read
  <i>fate</i>, not <i>face</i>; the confusion between <i>c</i> and <i>t</i>
  is endless. Perhaps <i>governours</i> in l. 144 should be
  <i>governour</i>, as in l. 147. Note that the author seems to condemn the
  disturbers of the peace.</p>

  <p>157. <i>coarted by payninge dures</i>, constrained by painful duress
  (or torture).</p>

  <p>165. <i>sacrament</i>, my oath of allegiance. Note that the author
  takes credit for giving evidence <i>against</i> the riotous people; for
  which the populace condemned him as a liar (l. 171).</p>

  <p>178. <i>passed</i>, surpassed (every one), in giving me an infamous
  character.</p>

  <p>181. <i>reply</i>, i.e. to subvert, entirely alter, recall; lit. to
  fold or bend back.</p>

  <p>189. Here the author says, more plainly, that he became unpopular for
  revealing a conspiracy.</p>

  <p>193. <i>out of denwere</i>, out of doubt, without doubt. Such is
  clearly the sense; but the word <i>denwere</i> is rejected from the New
  E. Dict., as it is not otherwise known, and its form is suspicious. It is
  also omitted in Webster and in the Century Dictionary. Bailey has
  '<i>denwere</i>, doubt,' taken from Speght's Chaucer, and derived from
  this very passage. Hence Chatterton obtained the word, which he was glad
  to employ. It occurs, for instance, in his poem of Goddwyn, ed. Skeat,
  vol. ii. p. 100:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&mdash;'No <i>denwere</i> in my breast I of them feel.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The right phrase is simply <i>out of were</i>; cf. 'withoute were' in
  the Book of the Duchess, 1295. I think the letters <i>den</i> may have
  been prefixed accidentally. The line, as printed in Thynne, stands thus:
  'denwere al the sothe knowe of these thinges.' I suggest that <i>den</i>
  is an error for <i>don</i>, and the word <i>don</i> ought to come at the
  <i>end</i> of the line (after <i>thinges</i>) instead of at the
  beginning. This would give the readings <!-- Page 460 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page460"></a>[460]</span>'out of were' and
  'these thinges don in acte'; both of which are improvements.</p>

  <p>194. <i>but as</i>, only as, exactly as.</p>

  <p>198. <i>clerkes</i>, i.e. Chaucer, HF. 350; Vergil, Aen. iv. 174.</p>

  <p>200. <i>of mene</i>, make mention of. Cf. 'hit is a schep[h]erde
  <i>that I of mene</i>'; Ancient Metrical Tales, ed. Hartshorne, p.
  74.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. VII.</b> 10. <i>profered</i>, offered wager of battle; hence
  the mention of <i>Mars</i> in l. 11. Cf. note to ch. ii. 191 above, p.
  455.</p>

  <p>23. <i>he</i>, i.e. thine adversary shall bring dishonour upon you in
  no way.</p>

  <p>34. <i>Indifferent</i>, impartial. <i>who</i>, whoever.</p>

  <p>38. <i>discovered</i>, betrayed; so that the author admits that he
  betrayed his mistress.</p>

  <p>46. <i>that sacrament</i>, that the oath to which you swore, viz. when
  you were charged upon your oath to tell the truth. That is, his oath in
  the court of justice made him break his private oath.</p>

  <p>49. <i>trewe</i> is certainly an error for <i>trewthe</i>; the
  statement is copied from Jer. iv. 2:&mdash;' Et iurabis ... in veritate,
  et in iudicio, et in justitia.' So in l. 58 below, we have: 'in jugement,
  <i>in trouthe</i>, and rightwisenesse'; and in l. 53&mdash;'for a man to
  say truth, unless judgement and righteousness accompany it, he is
  forsworn.'</p>

  <p>54. <i>serment</i>, oath; as in l. 52: referring to Matt. xiv. 7.</p>

  <p>56. 'Moreover, it is sometimes forbidden to say truth
  rightfully&mdash;except in a trial&mdash;because all truths are not to be
  disclosed.'</p>

  <p>60. <i>that worde</i>: 'melius mori quam male vivere'; for which see
  P. Plowman, C. xviii. 40. Somewhat altered from Tobit, iii.
  6:&mdash;'expedit mihi mori magis quam vivere.'</p>

  <p>61, 62. <i>al</i>, although, <i>enfame</i>, dishonour; as in vi. 3
  (see note, p. 458).</p>

  <p>63. <i>whan</i>, yet when.</p>

  <p>73. <i>legen</i>, short for <i>alegen</i>; 'allege against
  others.'</p>

  <p>75. Here misprinted; <i>read</i>:&mdash;'may it be sayd, "in that
  thinge this man thou demest,"' &amp;c. From Rom. ii. 1; 'in quo enim
  iudicas alterum, teipsum condemnas.'</p>

  <p>83. <i>shrewe</i>, wicked man, i.e. Ham; Gen. ix. 22.</p>

  <p>101. <i>emprisonned</i>; so in Thynne; better, <i>emprisouned</i>.</p>

  <p>104. <i>brige</i>, contention, struggle, trouble; see note to Ch. C.
  T., B 2872.</p>

  <p>105. <i>after thyne helpes</i>, for your aid; i.e. to receive
  assistance from you.</p>

  <p>108. <i>Selande</i>, Zealand, Zeeland. The port of Middleburg, in the
  isle of Walcheren, was familiar to the English; cf. note to C. T., Prol.
  277. The reference must be to some companions of the author who had fled
  to Zealand to be out of the way of prosecution. <i>rydinge</i>,
  expedition on horseback, journey.</p>

  <p>109, 110. <i>for thy chambre</i>, to pay the rent of your room.
  <i>renter</i>, landlord; 'unknown to the landlord.'</p>

  <p>112. <i>helpe of unkyndnesse</i>, relieve from unkind treatment. <!--
  Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page461"></a>[461]</span></p>

  <p>115-6. <i>fleddest</i>, didst avoid. <i>privitè to counsayle</i>,
  knowledge of a secret.</p>

  <p>120-1. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 8. ll. 31-3.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. VIII.</b> 1. <i>Eft</i>, again. Thynne prints <i>Ofte</i>,
  which does not give the sense required. Fortunately, we know that the
  first letter <i>must</i> be E, in order that the initial letters of the
  Prologue and chapters I. to VIII. may give the word MARGARETE. The
  reading <i>Ofte</i> would turn this into MARGARETO.</p>

  <p>4, 5. From Ch. Troil. iv. 3; Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 8. ll. 19-21.</p>

  <p>13. <i>and thou</i>, if thou. Cf. Matt. xviii. 12.</p>

  <p>27. <i>in their mouthes</i>, into their mouths; Matt. xii. 34.</p>

  <p>31. <i>leve for no wight</i>, cease not on any one's account.</p>

  <p>32. <i>use Jacobs wordes</i>. The allusion seems to be to the
  conciliatory conduct of Jacob towards Esau; Gen. xxxiii. 8, 10, 11.
  Similarly the author is to be patient, and to say&mdash;'I will endure my
  lady's wrath, which I have deserved,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>41. <i>sowe hem</i>, to sew them together again. <i>at his
  worshippe</i>, in honour of him; but I can find no antecedent to
  <i>his</i>. Perhaps for <i>his</i> we should read <i>her</i>.</p>

  <p>44. The text has <i>forgoing al errour distroyeng causeth</i>; but
  <i>distroyeng</i> (which may have been a gloss upon <i>forgoing</i>) is
  superfluous, and <i>al</i> should be <i>of</i>. But <i>forgoing</i> means
  rather 'abandonment.'</p>

  <p>55. <i>passest</i>, surpassest.</p>

  <p>59. <i>by</i>, with reference to.</p>

  <p>61. Hector, according to Guido delle Colonne, gave counsel against
  going to war with the Greeks, but was overborne by Paris. See the
  alliterative Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and Donaldson (E. E. T. S.),
  Book VI; or Lydgate's Siege of Troye, ch. xii.</p>

  <p>65. <i>leveth</i>, neglects to oppose what is wrong.</p>

  <p>66. The modern proverb is: 'silence gives consent.' Ray gives, as the
  Latin equivalent, 'qui tacet consentire videtur (inquiunt iuris
  consulti).' This is the exact form which is here translated.</p>

  <p>73. Alluding to the canticle 'Exultet' sung upon Easter Eve, in the
  Sarum Missal:&mdash;'O certe necessarium Ade peccatum.' See note to P.
  Plowman, C. viii. 126 (or B. v. 491).</p>

  <p>80. <i>lurken</i>, creep into lurking-holes, slink away.</p>

  <p>95. <i>centre</i>, central point; from Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 7. ll.
  18-20. The whole passage (ll. 94-105) is imitated from the same 'prose'
  of Boethius.</p>

  <p>103. <i>London</i> is substituted for 'Rome' in Chaucer's Boethius.
  Chaucer has&mdash;'may thanne the glorie of a singuler Romaine strecchen
  thider as the fame of the name of Rome may nat climben or passen?' See
  the last note.</p>

  <p>112-6. From Ch. Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 7. 58-62.</p>

  <p>116-25. From the same, ll. 65-79. Thus, in l. 123, the word
  <i>ofte</i> (in Thynne) is a misprint for <i>of the</i>; for Chaucer
  has&mdash;'For of thinges that han ende may be maked comparisoun.' The
  whole passage shews that the author consulted Chaucer's translation of
  Boethius rather than the Latin text. <!-- Page 462 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page462"></a>[462]</span></p>

  <p>127. <i>and thou canst nothing don aright</i>; literally from Chaucer:
  'Ye men, certes, <i>ne conne don nothing aright</i>'; Boeth. bk. ii. pr.
  7. 79. <i>but thou desyre the rumour therof be heled and in every wightes
  ere</i>; corresponds to Chaucer's&mdash;'but-yif it be for the audience
  of the people and for ydel rumours'; Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 7. 80. Hence
  <i>heled</i> (lit. hidden) is quite inadmissible; the right reading is
  probably <i>deled</i>, i.e. dealt round.</p>

  <p>134. The words supplied are necessary; they dropped out owing to the
  repetition of <i>vertue</i>.</p>

  <p>135-6. Again copied from Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 7. 106: 'the sowle ...
  unbounden fro the prison of the erthe.'</p>

  <p><b>Chap. IX.</b> 13. <i>than leveth there</i>, then it remains.</p>

  <p>15. <i>for thy moebles</i>, because thy goods.</p>

  <p>20. This proverb is given by Hazlitt in the form&mdash;</p>

  <p>Cf. 'one looketh high as one that feareth no chips'; Lyly's Euphues,
  ed. Arber, p. 467. And see IX. 158 (p. 270).</p>

  <p>34. From Chaucer, Boeth. bk. i. pr. 4. 186. The saying is attributed
  to Pythagoras; see the passage in Chaucer, and the note upon it.</p>

  <p>39. <i>a this halfe god</i>, on this side of God, i.e. here below; a
  strange expression. So again in bk. ii. ch. 13. 23.</p>

  <p>46. <i>the foure elementes</i>, earth, air, fire, and water; see notes
  to Ch. C. T., A 420, 1247, G 1460. <i>Al universitee</i>, the whole
  universe; hence man was called the microcosm, or the universe in little;
  see Coriolanus, ii. 1. 68.</p>

  <p>64. <i>I sette now</i>, I will now suppose the most difficult case;
  suppose that thou shouldst die in my service.</p>

  <p>71. <i>in this persone</i>; read <i>on this persone</i>; or else,
  perhaps, <i>in this prisoune</i>.</p>

  <p>86. <i>til deth hem departe</i>; according to the phrase 'till death
  us depart' in the Marriage Service, now ingeniously altered to 'till
  death us <i>do part</i>.'</p>

  <p>96. 'and although they both break the agreement.'</p>

  <p>98, 99. <i>accord</i>, betrothal. <i>the rose</i>, i.e. of virginity;
  as in the Romance of the Rose, when interpreted.</p>

  <p>99, 100. <i>Marye his spouse</i>. But the Vulgate has; 'Surge, et
  accipe puerum et <i>matrem eius</i>'; Matt. ii. 13. The author must have
  been thinking of Matt. i. 18: 'Cum esset <i>desponsata</i> mater eius
  Maria Ioseph.'</p>

  <p>113. <i>al being thinges</i>, all things that exist.</p>

  <p>118. <i>prophete</i>; David, in Ps. xcvi. 5: (xcv. 5 in the Vulgate):
  'omnes dii gentium daemonia.'</p>

  <p>129. This refers back to ch. iv. 71-2, ch. ix. 14, 20, 56.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. X.</b> 5. <i>last objeccion</i>; i.e. his poverty, see ch.
  iii. 131, iv. 73, ix. 14. <!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>12-8. Imitated from Ch. Boeth. bk. i. pr. 4. 200-17.</p>

  <p>18. <i>sayd</i>, i.e. it is said of him.</p>

  <p>19. <i>aver</i>, property, wealth; 'lo! how the false man, for the
  sake of his wealth, is accounted true!'</p>

  <p>20. <i>dignitees</i>; cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 6.</p>

  <p>21. <i>were he out</i>, if he were not in office; cf. l. 23.</p>

  <p>26-37. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. i. met. 5. 22-39. Thus, <i>slydinge
  chaunges</i> in l. 31 answers to Chaucer's <i>slydinge fortune</i> (l.
  24); and <i>that arn a fayr parcel of the erthe</i>, in l. 32, to <i>a
  fayr party of so grete a werk</i> (l. 38); and yet again, <i>thou that
  knittest</i>, in l. 35, to <i>what so ever thou be that knittest</i> (l.
  36).</p>

  <p>37-40. From Ch. Boeth. bk. i. met 5. 27-30.</p>

  <p>64-7. From the same; bk. ii. pr. 2. 7-12.</p>

  <p>71-6. From the same; bk. ii. pr. 2. 23-5.</p>

  <p>76-80. Cf. the argument in the same; bk. iii. pr. 3.</p>

  <p>85-120. From Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 8. For literal imitations, compare
  <i>the other haleth him to vertue by the hookes of thoughtes</i> (l.
  104-5) with Chaucer's 'the contrarious Fortune ... haleth hem ayein as
  with an hooke' (l. 21); and <i>Is nat a greet good ... for to knowe the
  hertes of thy sothfast frendes</i> (ll. 107-9) with Chaucer's 'wenest
  thou thanne that thou oughtest to leten this a litel thing, that this ...
  Fortune hath discovered to thee the thoughtes of thy trewe frendes' (l.
  22). Also ll. 114-6 with Chaucer (ll. 28-31).</p>

  <p>126. <i>let us singen</i>; in imitation of the Metres in Boethius,
  which break the prose part of the treatise at frequent intervals. Cf.
  'and bigan anon to singen right thus'; Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 9. 149.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Book II.</span></p>

  <p><b>Chap. I.</b> The initials of the fourteen Chapters in this Book
  give the words: <span class="sm">VIRTW HAVE MERCI</span>. Thynne has not
  preserved the right division, but makes <i>fifteen</i> chapters, giving
  the words: <span class="sc">VIRTW HAVE M<i>CT</i>RCI</span>. I have set
  this right, by making Chap. XI begin with 'Every.' Thynne makes Chapter
  XI begin with 'Certayn,' p. 86, l. 133, and another Chapter begin with
  'Trewly,' p. 89, l. 82. This cannot be right, because the latter word,
  'Trewly,' belongs to the last clause of a sentence; and the Chapter thus
  beginning would have the unusually small number of 57 lines.</p>

  <p>1. Chapter I really forms a Prologue to the Second Book, interrupting
  our progress. At the end of Book I we are told that Love is about to
  sing, but her song begins with Chap. II. Hence this first Chapter must be
  regarded as a digression, in which the author reviews what has gone
  before (ll. 10-3), and anticipates what is to come (l. 61).</p>

  <p>9. <i>steering</i>, government (of God), <i>otherwysed</i>, changed,
  varied; an extraordinary form.</p>

  <p>12, 13. <i>after as</i>, according as. <i>hildeth</i>, outpours.</p>

  <p>14-8. There is clearly much corruption in this unintelligible and <!--
  Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page464"></a>[464]</span>imperfect sentence. The reference to 'the
  Roman emperor' is mysterious.</p>

  <p>21. <i>woweth</i>; so in Thynne, but probably an error for
  <i>waweth</i>, i.e. move, shift; see <i>wa&#x21D;ien</i> in
  Stratmann.</p>

  <p>23. <i>phane</i>, vane; cf. 'chaunging as a vane'; Ch. C. T., E
  996.</p>

  <p>34. <i>irrecuperable</i>, irrecoverable; <i>irrecuperabilis</i> is
  used by Tertullian (Lewis and Short).</p>

  <p>40. <i>armes</i>; this refers, possibly, to the struggle between the
  pope and anti-pope, after the year 1378.</p>

  <p>51-2. <i>lovers clerk</i>, clerk of lovers; but perhaps an error for
  <i>Loves clerk</i>; cf. Troil. iii. 41.</p>

  <p>62-3. <i>ryder and goer</i>, rider on horseback and walker on
  foot.</p>

  <p>77. Translated from 'Fides non habet meritum ubi humana ratio praebet
  experimentum'; as quoted in P. Plowman, C. xii. 160. This is slightly
  altered from a saying of St. Gregory (xl. Homil. in Evangelium, lib. ii.
  homil. 26)&mdash;'nec fides humana habet meritum cui humana ratio praebet
  experimentum.' See note to P. Plowman (as above).</p>

  <p>83. <i>as by a glasse</i>, as in a mirror; 1 Cor. xiii. 12.</p>

  <p>93. <i>cockle</i>, tares. This seems to refer to the Lollards, as puns
  upon the words <i>Lollard</i> and <i>lolia</i> were very rife at this
  period. If so, the author had ceased to approve of Lollard notions. In l.
  94, <i>love</i> seems to mean Christian charity, in its highest sense;
  hence it is called, in l. 95, the most precious thing in nature.</p>

  <p>96, 97. The passage seems corrupt, and I cannot quite see what is
  meant. Perhaps read: 'with many eke-names, [and] that [to] other thinges
  that the soule [seketh after, men] yeven the ilke noble name.' The comma
  after <i>kynde</i> in l. 96 represents a down-stroke (equivalent to a
  comma) in Thynne; but it is not wanted.</p>

  <p>99. <i>to thee</i>, i.e. to the 'Margaret of virtue' whose name
  appears as an acrostic at the head of the Chapters in Book I. and
  Chapters I-V of Book II; moreover, we find at last that Margaret
  signifies Holy Church, to which the treatise is accordingly dedicated.
  <i>tytled of Loves name</i>, entitled the Testament of Love.</p>

  <p>103. <i>inseëres</i>, lookers into it, readers.</p>

  <p>104. <i>Every thing</i>; with respect to everything to which
  appertains a cause which is wrought with a view to its accomplishment,
  Aristotle supposes that the doing of everything is, in a manner, its
  final cause. 'Final cause' is a technical term, explained in the New E.
  Dict. as 'a term introduced into philosophical language by the schoolmen
  as a translation of Aristotle's fourth cause, <span title="to hou heneka" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F78; &omicron;&#x1F57;
  &#x1F15;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;</span> or <span title="telos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, the end or purpose for
  which a thing is done, viewed as the cause of the act; especially as
  applied in Natural Theology to the design, purpose, or end of the
  arrangements of the universe.' The phrase 'the end in view' comes near to
  expressing it, and will serve to explain 'A final cause' in the next
  clause.</p>

  <p>107. <i>is finally to thilke ende</i>, is done with a view to that
  result. <!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page465"></a>[465]</span></p>

  <p>109. After <i>so</i>, understand 'is it with regard to.'</p>

  <p>110. <i>the cause</i>, the cause whereby I am directed, and that for
  which I ought to write it, are both alike noble.</p>

  <p>113. <i>this leude</i>, &amp;c.; I have set about learning this
  alphabet; for I cannot, as yet, go beyond counting up to three.</p>

  <p>115. <i>in joininge</i>, &amp;c.; by proceeding to the joining
  together of syllables.</p>

  <p>124. <i>in bright whele</i>, in (its) bright circuit. Chaucer has
  <i>wheel</i> in the sense of orbit; HF. 1450.</p>

  <p>126. <i>another tretyse</i>. As to this proposed treatise nothing is
  known. Perhaps it never was written.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. II.</b> 2. <i>in Latin</i>. This suggests that the present
  chapter may be adapted from some Latin original; especially as the author
  only gives the <i>sentence</i> or general drift of it. But the remark may
  mean nothing, and the tone of the chapter is wholly medieval.</p>

  <p>24. <i>Saturnes sphere</i>, Saturn's orbit; the supposed outer
  boundary of the spheres of the seven planets.</p>

  <p>27. <i>me have</i>, possess me (i.e. love), since Love is the speaker;
  i.e. they think they can procure men's love by heaping up wealth.</p>

  <p>28. Perhaps place the comma after <i>sowed</i> (sewn), not after
  <i>sakke</i>.</p>

  <p>29. <i>pannes</i>, better spelt <i>panes</i>; see <i>pane</i> in
  Stratmann. From O.F. <i>pan</i>, <i>panne</i>, Lat. <i>pannus</i>, a
  cloth, garment, robe. <i>mouled</i>, become mouldy; the very form from
  which the mod. E. <i>mould-y</i> has been evolved; see <i>muwlen</i> in
  Stratmann, and <i>mouldy</i> in my Etym. Dict. (Supplement).
  <i>whicche</i>, chest, from A.S. <i>hwæcca</i>; see P. Plowm. A. iv. 102,
  where some copies have <i>huche</i>, a hutch, a word of French origin.
  Thus <i>pannes mouled in a whicche</i> signifies garments that have
  become mouldy in a chest. See note to C. T., C 734.</p>

  <p>30. <i>presse</i>, a clothes-press; observe the context.</p>

  <p>35. <i>seventh</i>; perhaps an error for <i>thirde</i>; cf. 'percussa
  est tertia pars solis'; Rev. viii. 12. He is referring to the primitive
  days of the Church, when 'the pope went afoot.'</p>

  <p>40. <i>defended</i>, forbade (opposed) those taxations. See
  <i>Taylage</i> in Ch. Glossary.</p>

  <p>42. <i>maryed</i>, caused to be married; cf. P. Plowman, B. vii.
  29.</p>

  <p>47. <i>symonye</i>, simony; cf. note to P. Plowman, C. iii. 63.</p>

  <p>48. Observe the rimes: <i>achates, debates</i>; <i>wronges,
  songes</i>.</p>

  <p>49. <i>for his wronges</i>, on account of the wrongs which he commits.
  <i>personer</i>, better <i>parsoner</i> or <i>parcener</i>, participant,
  sharer; i.e. the steward, courtier, escheator, and idle minstrel, all get
  something. See <i>parcener</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>50. 'And each one gets his prebend (or share) all for himself, with
  which many thrifty people ought to profit.'</p>

  <p>51. <i>behynde</i>, behindhand; even these wicked people are
  neglected, in comparison with the <i>losengeour</i>, or flatterer.</p>

  <p>52. Note the rimes, <i>forsake, take</i>. <i>it acordeth</i>, it
  agrees, it is all consistent; see note to l. 74 below. <!-- Page 466
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page466"></a>[466]</span></p>

  <p>55. <i>at matins</i>; cf. P. Plowm. C. i. 125, viii. 27.</p>

  <p>56. <i>bene-breed</i>, bean-bread; cf. P. Plowm. C. ix. 327.</p>

  <p>57, 58. Cf. P. Plowman, C. vi. 160-5.</p>

  <p>60. <i>shete</i>, a sheet, instead of a napkin to cover the bread;
  <i>god</i> refers to the eucharist.</p>

  <p>62. <i>a clergion</i>, a chorister-boy; see Ch. C. T., B 1693, and the
  note.</p>

  <p>65. <i>broken</i>, torn; as in P. Plowm. B. v. 108, ix. 91.</p>

  <p>66. <i>good houndes</i>; cf. P. Plowm. C. vi. 161-5.</p>

  <p>69. <i>dolven</i>, buried; 'because they (the poor) always crave an
  alms, and never make an offering, they (the priests) would like to see
  them dead and buried.'</p>

  <p>69. <i>legistres</i>, lawyers; 'legistres of bothe the lawes,' P.
  Plowm. B. vii. 14.</p>

  <p>71. 'For then wrong and force would not be worth a haw anywhere.'
  Before <i>plesen</i> something seems lost; perhaps read&mdash;'and [thou
  canst] plesen,' i.e. and you can please no one, unless those oppressive
  and wrong-doing lawyers are in power and full action.'</p>

  <p>74. <i>ryme</i>, rime. The reference is not to actual jingle of rime,
  but to a proverb then current. In a poem by Lydgate in MS. Harl. 2251
  (fol. 26), beginning&mdash;'Alle thynge in kynde desirith thynge i-like,'
  the refrain to every stanza runs thus:&mdash;'It may wele ryme, but it
  accordith nought'; see his Minor Poems, ed. Halliwell, p. 55. The sense
  is that unlike things may be brought together, like riming words, but
  they will not on that account agree. So here: such things may seem, to
  all appearance, congruous, but they are really inconsistent. Cf. note to
  l. 52 above.</p>

  <p>79. <i>beestly wit</i>, animal intelligence.</p>

  <p>99. <i>cosinage</i>, those who are my relatives.</p>

  <p>104. <i>behynde</i>, behindhand, in the rear. <i>passe</i>, to
  surpass, be prominent.</p>

  <p>109. <i>comeden</i> is false grammar for <i>comen</i>, came; perhaps
  it is a misprint. The reference is to Gen. ix. 27: 'God shall enlarge
  Japheth  ... and Canaan shall be his servant.' The author has turned
  <i>Canaan</i> into <i>Cayn</i>, and has further confused Canaan with his
  father Ham!</p>

  <p>112. <i>gentilesse</i>; cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 6. 31-4; C. T., D
  1109.</p>

  <p>116. <i>Perdicas</i>, Perdiccas, son of Orontes, a famous general
  under Alexander the Great. This king, on his death-bed, is said to have
  taken the royal signet-ring from his finger and to have given it to
  Perdiccas. After Alexander's death, Perdiccas held the chief authority
  under the new king Arrhidaeus; and it was really Arrhidaeus (not
  Perdiccas) who was the son of a <i>tombestere</i>, or female dancer, and
  of Philip of Macedonia; so that he was Alexander's half brother. The
  dancer's name was Philinna, of Larissa. In the Romance of Alexander, the
  dying king bequeaths to Perdiccas the kingdom of Greece; cf. note to bk.
  iii. c. ii. l. 25. Hence the confusion. <!-- Page 467 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page467"></a>[467]</span></p>

  <p>122. Copied from Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. met. 6:&mdash;'Al the linage of
  men that ben in erthe ben of semblable birthe. On allone is fader of
  thinges.... Why noisen ye or bosten of your eldres? For yif thou loke
  your biginninge, and god your auctor and maker,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>135. <i>one</i>; i.e. the Virgin Mary.</p>

  <p>139. After <i>secte</i>, supply <i>I</i>:&mdash;'that, in any respect,
  I may so hold an opinion against her sex.' <i>Secte</i> is properly
  'suite'; but here means <i>sex</i>; cf. l. 134.</p>

  <p>140. <i>in hem</i>, in them, i.e. in women. And so in l. 141.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. III.</b> 8. <i>victorie of strength</i>; because, according
  to the first book of Esdras, iv. 14, 15, women are the strongest of all
  things.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Esdram</i>, accus. of Esdras, with reference to the first book
  of Esdras, called 'liber Esdrae tertius' in the Vulgate.</p>

  <p>9, 10. <i>whos lordship al lignes</i>. Something is lost here;
  <i>lordship</i> comes at the end of a line; perhaps the insertion of
  <i>passeth</i> will give some sort of sense; <i>whos lordship [passeth]
  al lignes</i>, whose lordship surpasses all lines. But <i>lignes</i> is
  probably a corrupt reading.</p>

  <p>10. <i>who is</i>, i.e. who is it that? The Vulgate has: 'Quis est
  ergo qui dominatur eorum? Nonne mulieres genuerunt regem,' &amp;c. But
  the A. V. has: 'Who is it then that ruleth them, or hath the lordship
  over them? Are they not women? Women have borne the king,' &amp;c. This
  translates a text in which <i>mulieres</i> has been repeated.</p>

  <p>17-21. From 1 Esdras, iv. 15-7: 'Women have borne the king and all the
  people that bear rule by sea and land. Even of them came they: and they
  nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence the wine
  cometh. These also make garments [Lat. <i>stolas</i>] for men; these
  bring glory unto men; and without women cannot men be.'</p>

  <p>21-5. Adapted from 1 Esdras, iv. 18, 19.</p>

  <p>30. 'That by no way can they refuse his desire to one that asks
  well.'</p>

  <p>32. <i>of your sectes</i>, of your followers, of those of your sex.
  Cf. chap. 2. 139 above, and the note.</p>

  <p>38. <i>wenen</i>, imagine that your promises are all gospel-truth; cf.
  Legend of Good Women, 326 (earlier version).</p>

  <p>41. <i>so maked</i>; 'and that (i.e. the male sex) is so made
  sovereign and to be entreated, that was previously servant and used the
  voice of prayer.' Men begin by entreating, and women then surrender their
  sovereignty.</p>

  <p>43. <i>trewe</i>; used ironically; i.e. untrue.</p>

  <p>45, 46. <i>what thing to women it is</i>, what a thing it is for
  women. Ll. 45-58 are borrowed, sometimes word for word, from Ch. HF.
  269-85. See note to l. 70 below, and the Introduction, <a
  href="#sect11">§ 11</a>.</p>

  <p>47. 'All that glisters is not gold'; see Ch. C. T., G 962, and the
  note. But it is here copied from Ch. HF. 272.</p>

  <p>55. <i>whistel</i>, pipe. Cf. note to P. Plowm. B. xv. 467.</p>

  <p>60. <i>is put</i>, i.e. she (each one of them) is led to suppose. <!--

  <p>63, 64. Copied from Ch. HF. 305-10.</p>

  <p>67. <i>they</i>, i.e. women; cf. l. 58. So also in l. 68.</p>

  <p>68. <i>ye</i>, i.e. ye men; so also <i>you</i> in l. 69.</p>

  <p>70-81. Expanded from Ch. HF. 332-59; observe how some phrases are
  preserved.</p>

  <p>91. 'Faciamus ei adiutorium simile sibi'; Gen. ii. 18.</p>

  <p>92. <i>this tree</i>, i.e. Eve, womankind. So in l. 96.</p>

  <p>100. 'What is heaven the worse, though Saracens lie concerning
  it?'</p>

  <p>111. <i>dames</i>, mothers; cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. met. 6. 1-9.</p>

  <p>114. <i>way</i>, path; <i>it lightly passe</i>, easily go along
  it.</p>

  <p>115. This proverb is copied from Ch. HF. 290-1; just as the proverb in
  l. 47 is from the same, l. 272. Compare p. 22, ll. 44-5.</p>

  <p>131-2. Obscure; and apparently imperfect.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. IV.</b> 2. Either <i>my</i> or <i>to me</i> should be struck
  out.</p>

  <p>4-8. From Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 2. 3-8. 14-6. From the same,
  8-12.</p>

  <p>20-1. <i>by wayes of riches</i>; cf. <i>richesses</i> in Ch. Boeth.
  bk. iii. pr. 2. 20; so also <i>dignite</i> answers to <i>digne</i> of
  <i>reverence</i> in the same, l. 21; <i>power</i> occurs in the same, l.
  24; and <i>renomè</i> answers to <i>renoun</i> in l. 26.</p>

  <p>21. <i>wening me</i>, seeing that I supposed.</p>

  <p>22. <i>turneth</i>; 'it goes against the hair.' We now
  say&mdash;'against the grain.'</p>

  <p>45. The words between square brackets must be supplied.</p>

  <p>55. <i>holden for absolute</i>, considered as free, separate, or
  detached; as in Ch. Boeth. bk. v. pr. 6. 169.</p>

  <p>56. <i>leveth in</i>, there remain in, i.e. remain for consideration,
  remain to be considered. When 'bestial' living is set aside, 'manly' and
  'resonable' are left.</p>

  <p>61. <i>riches</i>, &amp;c.; from Boethius. See <i>riches</i> discussed
  in Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 5; <i>dignitè</i>, in pr. 6; <i>renomè</i>, or
  fame, in pr. 7; and <i>power</i>, along with <i>dignitè</i>, in pr.
  6.</p>

  <p>99. <i>as a litel assay</i>, as if for a short trial, for a while.</p>

  <p>100. <i>songedest</i>, didst dream; from F. <i>songer</i>. I know of
  no other example of this verb in English. However, Langland has
  <i>songewarie</i>, interpretation of dreams, P. Plowman, C. x. 302.</p>

  <p>113. <i>thy king</i>; presumably, Richard II; cf. l. 120.</p>

  <p>116. <i>to oblige</i>, to subject thy body to deeds of arms, to offer
  to fight judicially; as already said above; cf. bk. i. c. 7. 10.</p>

  <p>138. 'Love and the bliss already spoken of above (cf. 'the parfit
  blisse of love,' bk. ii. c. 1. 79) shall be called "the knot" in the
  heart.' This definition of "the knot," viz. as being the perfect bliss or
  full fruition of love, should be noted; because, in later chapters, the
  author continually uses the phrase "the knot," without explaining what he
  means by it. It answers to 'sovereyn blisfulnesse' in Chaucer's
  Boethius.</p>

  <p>141. <i>inpossession</i> is all one word, but is clearly an error. The
  right word is certainly <i>imposition</i>. The Lat. <i>impositio</i> was
  a grammatical term, used by Varro, signifying the <i>imposing</i> of a
  name, or the <!-- Page 469 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page469"></a>[469]</span>application of a name to an object; and
  the same sense of O.F. <i>imposition</i> appears in a quotation given by
  Godefroy. It is just the word required. When Love declares that she shall
  give the name of "the knot" to the perfect bliss of love, the author
  replies, 'I shall well understand the application of this name,' i.e.
  what you mean by it; cf. l. 149.</p>

  <p>147. <i>A goddes halfe</i>, lit. on the side of God; with much the
  same sense as in God's name; see Ch. C. T., D 50.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. V.</b> 3. <i>richesse</i> is singular; it was probably Thynne
  who put the following verbs into plural forms.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Aristotle</i>. Perhaps the reference is to the Nicomachean
  Ethics, i. 1.</p>

  <p>15-20. The argument is from Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 5. 84, 122.</p>

  <p>57, 58. From Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 5. 45-7.</p>

  <p>65. Cf. 'Why embracest thou straunge goodes as they weren thyne?' Ch.
  Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 5. 50.</p>

  <p>67-77. From Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 5. 52-69.</p>

  <p>79-110. From the same; ll. 71-80; 88-133.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. VI.</b> Suggested by Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 6.</p>

  <p>11-4. From the same, 57, 58; 54-7; 62-4.</p>

  <p>25. <i>dignites ... is as the sonne</i>; the verb <i>is</i> agrees
  with the latter substantive <i>sonne</i>.</p>

  <p>26-9. From the same as above, 4-6; the author substitutes <i>wilde
  fyre</i> for Chaucer's <i>flaumbe of Ethna</i>.</p>

  <p>30. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 6. 75-8.</p>

  <p>38. Perhaps read <i>dignitè in suche thing tene y-wrought</i>; 'as
  dignity in such a case wrought harm, so, on the contrary, the substance
  in dignity, being changed, rallied (so as) to bring in again a good
  condition in its effect.' Obscure. 'Dignities' are further discussed in
  Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4.</p>

  <p>74-7. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4. 64-70.</p>

  <p>78. <i>Nero</i>. The name was evidently suggested by the mention of
  Nero immediately after the end of Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4 (viz. in met. 4);
  but the story of Nero killing his mother is from an earlier passage in
  Boethius, viz. bk. ii. met. 6.</p>

  <p>81. <i>king John</i>. By asserting his 'dignity' as king against
  prince Arthur, he brought about a war in which the greater part of the
  French possessions of the crown were lost.</p>

  <p>82. <i>nedeth in a person</i>, are necessary for a man.</p>

  <p>99. <i>such maner planettes</i>, planets such as those; referring to
  the sun and moon mentioned just above; ll. 87, 91. The sun and moon were
  then accounted as being among the seven planets.</p>

  <p>100-1. 'That have any desire for such (ill) shining planets to appear
  any more in that way.'</p>

  <p>117-8. <i>I not</i>, I do not know. <i>and thou see</i>, if thou
  shouldst see. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4. 22-7.</p>

  <p>123-8. From Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4. 31-9.</p>

  <p>127. <i>besmyteth</i>, contaminates, defiles. Note that the author is
  here reproducing Chaucer's <i>bispotten and defoulen</i> (pr. 4. 38). The
  word is <!-- Page 470 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page470"></a>[470]</span>noted in Stratmann, because the A.S.
  <i>besm&#x12B;tan</i>, in this sense, occurs in Mark, vii. 15. The form
  <i>besmitten</i> is commoner, four examples of it being given in the New
  E. Dict., s.v. <i>besmit</i>. The verb <i>besmite</i> has escaped
  recognition there, because the present passage has not been noted. So
  also, in the next line, <i>smyteth</i> has a like sense. <i>Smitted</i>
  occurs in Troilus, v. 1545.</p>

  <p>129. <i>fyr</i>, fire; from Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4. 47.</p>

  <p>132-4. From the same; ll. 48-53.</p>

  <p>138. The sentence is incomplete and gives no sense; probably a clause
  has dropped out after the word <i>goodnesse</i>. I cannot set it
  right.</p>

  <p>143-5. Imitated from Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 4. 55-7.</p>

  <p>153-6. Suggested by the same; ll. 64-70.</p>

  the seconde'; Fabyan, ed. Ellis, p. 260. 'In his fifty-fifth year he thus

  <p>81. <i>famulers</i>, household servants; borrowed from Chaucer's
  <i>familieres</i> in the same prose, l. 29.</p>

  <p>82. <i>sypher</i>, cipher in arithmetic. Though in itself it signifies

  <p>114-6. Here the author suddenly dashes off to another book of
  Boethius; see bk. ii. pr. 6. 44-5.</p>

  <p>117. <i>Buserus</i>; Chaucer has <i>Busirides</i> in his text of
  Boethius, bk. ii. pr. 6. 47 (whose text our author here follows); but
  <i>Busirus</i> in the Monkes Tale, B 3293. The true name is
  <i>Busiris</i>, of which <i>Busiridis</i> is the genitive case. Chaucer
  evolved the form <i>Busirides</i> out of the accusative <i>Busiridem</i>
  in Boethius. See note in vol. ii. p. 433.</p>

  <p>118. <i>Hugest</i>; substituted for the example of Regulus in
  Boethius. Hugest is probably an error for Hengest, i.e. Hengist. The
  story of his slaughter of the Britons at Stonehenge by a shameful
  treachery is famous; he certainly 'betrayed many men.' See Fabyan, ed.
  Ellis, p. 66; Rob. of Gloucester, l. 2651 (ed. Hearne, p. 124). The story
  of his death is not inconsistent with the text. Rob. of Gloucester, at l.
  2957 (ed. Hearne, p. 140) tells how he was suddenly seized, in a battle,
  by Eldol, earl of Gloucester, who cried out for help; many came to his
  assistance, and Hengist was taken alive. Shortly afterwards, at the
  instance of Eldad, bishop of Gloucester, Eldol led him out of the town of
  Corneboru, and smote his head off. Eldad's verdict was:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Also doth by this mon that so moche wo ath y-do,</p>
      <p>So mony child y-mad faderles, dighteth him al-so.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The name of his betrayer or capturer is given as <i>Collo</i> in our
  text; but proper names take so many forms that it is not much to go by.
  Thus, the very name which is given as <i>Eldol</i> in one MS. of Robert
  of Gloucester (l. 2679) appears as <i>Cadel</i> in another. Fabyan calls
  him <i>Edolf</i> (p. 66), and makes him Earl of Chester. Layamon (ed.
  Madden, ii. 268) calls him <i>Aldolf</i>.</p>

  contradiction.</p>

  <p>39. <i>acorden</i>, agree; <i>by lacking</i>, with respect to blame

  <p>42. <i>elementes</i>, the four elements. Sir T. Elyot's Castel of
  Helthe (1539) presents the usual strange medieval notions on medicine. He
  begins by saying that we must consider the things natural, the things not
  natural, and the things against nature. The things natural are seven,
  viz. elements, complexions, humours, members, powers, operations, and
  spirits. 'The Elementes be those originall thynges vnmyxt and
  vncompounde, of whose temperance and myxture all other thynges, hauynge
  corporalle substance, be compacte: Of them be foure, that is to saye,
  Erthe, Water, Ayre, and Fyre.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Erthe</span> is the moost grosse and ponderouse
  element, and of her proper nature is <i>colde</i> and <i>drye</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Water</span> is more subtyll and lyght thanne erthe,
  but in respect of Ayre and Fyre, it is grosse and heuye, and of hir
  proper Nature is <i>colde</i> and <i>moyste</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ayre</span> is more lyghte and subtylle than the
  other two, and beinge not altered with any exteriour cause, is properly
  <i>hotte</i> and <i>moyste</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fyre</span> is absolutely lyght and clere, and is the
  clarifier of other elementes, if they be vyciate or out of their naturall
  temperaunce, and is properly <i>hotte</i> and <i>drye</i>.' Cf. Ch.
  Boeth. bk. iii. met. 9. 13-7.</p>

  <p>50. <i>oned</i>, united; see the last note.</p>

  <p>52. <i>erthe</i> (see the footnote) is an obvious error for
  <i>eyre</i>; so also in l. 53. But the whole of the argument is
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>68-9. Copied from Ch. Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 6. 3-4. From the Andromache

  line, the Northern pole-star.</p>

  <p>126. <i>out-waye-going</i>, going out of the way, error of conduct;
  which may be called, as it were, 'imprisonment,' or 'banishment.' It is
  called <i>Deviacion</i> in bk. iii. ch. i. 6, which see.</p>

  and 'in her hony galle'; C. T., B 3537.</p>

  <p>54. <i>Flebring</i>; omitted in the New E. Dict., as being a false
  form; there is no such word. Mr. Bradley suggests <i>flekring</i> or
  <i>flekering</i>, which is probable enough. The M.E. <i>flekeren</i>,
  also spelt <i>flikeren</i>, meant not only to flutter, but to be in
  doubt, to vacillate, and even to caress. We may take it to mean 'light
  speech' or 'gossip.'</p>

  <p>65. 'Good and yvel ben two contraries'; Ch. Boeth. bk. iv. pr. 2.
  10.</p>

  <p>74. <i>in that mores</i>, in the possession of that greater thing.</p>

  <p>77-8. Cf. l. 81 below. Hence the sense is: 'and that thing which
  belongs to it (i.e. to the knot) ought to incline to its superior cause
  out of honour and good-will.' But it is clumsy enough; and even to get
  this sense (which seems to have been that intended) we must alter
  <i>mores</i> to <i>more</i>. The form was probably miswritten
  <i>mores</i> here owing to the occurrence of <i>mores</i> just above (l.
  74) and just below (l. 79). It proceeds thus:&mdash;'otherwise, it is
  rebellious, and ought to be rejected from protection by its
  superior.'</p>

  <p>116. From Troil. iii. 1656-9.</p>

  <p>129-38. Perhaps the finest passage in the treatise, but not very
  original. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xxi. 456-7; Ch. Boeth. bk. iv. met. 6.

  <p>139. Imitated from Ch. Boeth. bk. ii. pr. 2. 54-5; but with the
  substitution of 'garmentes' for 'tonnes.'</p>

  <p>143. <i>proverbe</i>, proverb. 'When bale is hext (highest), then bote
  is next'; Proverbs of Hending; see notes to Gamelyn, ll. 32, 631, in vol.
  v. pp. 478, 486. For <i>hext</i> our author substitutes <i>a nyebore</i>,
  i.e. a neighbour, nigh at hand.</p>

  <p>151. The truth of astrology is here assumed.</p>

  <p>155-70. I suspect that this account of the days of the week (though no
  doubt familiar in those days to many) was really copied from Chaucer's
  Treatise on the Astrolabe, part ii. sect. 12 (vol. iii. p. 197). For it
  contains a remarkable blunder. The word <i>noon</i> in l. 163 should, of
  course, be <i>midnight</i>; but, as Chaucer omits to say when the first
  planetary hour of the day occurs, the author was left to himself in
  regard to this point. Few people understand <i>why</i> the day after
  Sunday must needs be Monday; yet it is very simple. The principle is
  given in the footnote to vol. iii. p. 197 (cf. vol. v. p. 86), but may
  here be stated a little more plainly. The earth being taken as the centre
  of the planetary system, the planets are arranged in the order of the
  radii of their orbits. The nearest planet is the Moon, then Mercury,
  Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. These were arranged by the
  astrologers in the <i>reverse</i> order; viz. Saturn, Jupiter, <!-- Page
  474 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page474"></a>[474]</span>Mars, Sun,
  Venus, Mercury, Moon; after which the rotation began over again, Saturn,
  Jupiter, Mars, &amp;c.; as before. If we now divide Sunday into
  twenty-four hours, and assign the <i>first</i> of these to the Sun, the
  <i>second</i> to Venus (next in rotation), the <i>third</i> to Mercury,
  and so on, the <i>eighth</i> hour will again fall to the Sun, and so will
  the <i>fifteenth</i> and the <i>twenty-second</i>. Consequently, the
  <i>twenty-third</i> (like the <i>second</i>) belongs to Venus, the
  <i>twenty-fourth</i> to Mercury, and the <i>twenty-fifth</i> to the Moon.
  But the twenty-fifth hour is the first hour of the new day, which is
  therefore the day of the Moon. And so throughout.</p>

  <p>Since the twenty-second hour belongs to the Sun, and the twenty-fifth
  to the Moon, the planetary interval from day to day is really obtained by
  pitching upon every <i>third</i> planet in the series, i.e. by skipping
  two. Hence the order of ruling planets for each day (which rule depends
  upon the assignment of the <i>first</i> hour) is obviously&mdash;the Sun,
  the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn; or, in Anglo-Saxon
  terminology, the Sun, the Moon, T&#x12B;w, W&#x14D;den, Thunor (Thur),
  Frige, and Sætern (Sæter).</p>

  the emblem of constancy and truth; see note to C. T., F 644 (vol. v. p.

  <p>47. The following is Pliny's account of the Pearl, as translated by
  Holland; bk. ix. c. 35.</p>

  <p>'This shell-fish which is the mother of Pearle, differs not much in
  the manner of breeding and generation from the Oysters; for when the
  season of the yeare requireth that they should engender, they seeme to
  yawne and gape, and so do open wide; and then (by report) they conceive a
  certaine moist dew as seed, wherewith they swell and grow big; ... and
  the fruit of these shell-fishes are the Pear[l]es, better or worse, great
  or small, according to the qualitie and quantitie of the dew which they
  receiued. For if the dew were pure and cleare which went into them, then
  are the Pearles white, faire, and Orient: but if grosse and troubled, the
  Pearles likewise are dimme, foule, and duskish; ... according as the
  morning is faire, so are they cleere; but otherwise, if it were misty and
  cloudy, they also will be thicke and muddy in colour.'</p>

  <p>50. The sense of <i>Margaryte</i> in <i>this</i> passage is the
  visible church of Christ, as the context shews. In book iii. ch. 9. 160,
  the author tells us that it signifies 'grace, lerning, or wisdom of god,
  or els <i>holy church</i>.' <!-- Page 476 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page476"></a>[476]</span></p>

  <p>52. <i>mekenesse</i>, humility; cf. l. 63. The church is descended
  from Christ, who is the heavenly dew.</p>

  <p>56. <i>reduced in-to good</i>, connected with good; <i>mene</i>,
  intermediate.</p>

  <p>58. <i>beestes</i>, living things that cannot move; the very word used
  by Chaucer, Boeth. bk. v. pr. 5. 20; compare the passage.</p>

  <p>64. There is something wrong; either <i>discendeth</i> should be
  <i>discended</i>, or we should understand <i>and</i> before <i>to</i>;
  and perhaps <i>downe</i> should be <i>dewe</i>; cf. l. 68. The reference
  seems to be to the Incarnation.</p>

  <p>68. Here the Protean word <i>Margaryte</i> means 'the wisdom of god,'
  judging by the context; see note to l. 50 above.</p>

  <p>78. This does not mean 'I would have explained it better,' but 'I
  should like to have it better explained.'</p>

  <p>86. <i>Margaryte</i> here means the visible church, as before (l. 50);
  to the end of the chapter.</p>

  <p>91. <i>welde</i>, possess; and all that he now possesses is his
  life.</p>

  <p>108. <i>yvel spekers</i>; this seems to allude to the Lollards, who
  ought (he says) to be 'stopped and ashamed.'</p>

  <p>114. This shews that Margarete does not mean a woman; for it is
  declared to be as precious as a woman, to whom it is likened.</p>

  <p>121. <i>deedly</i>, mortal. Hence Margarete does not mean the church
  in general, but the visible church at the time of writing, the church
  militant.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. XIII.</b> 11. 'To be evil, is to be nothing.' The general

  <p>23. <i>a this halfe</i>, on this side of, under; cf. note to bk. i.
  ch. 9. 39.</p>

  <p>30. <i>determinison</i>, determination; a correct form. Cf.
  <i>venison</i> from Lat. acc. <i>uenationem</i>. Accordingly, the O.F.
  forms were <i>determinaison</i>, <i><span class="nw">-eson</span></i>,
  <i><span class="nw">-oison</span></i>, as given by Godefroy. He supplies
  the example: 'Definicio, difinicion ou <i>determineson</i>,' from an old
  glossary. Hence <i>determination</i> is here used in the sense of
  'definition,' as is obvious from the context. Thynne prints
  <i>determission</i>, which makes nonsense; and there is no such word. The
  present passage is entered in the New E. Dict. under <i>determission</i>,
  with the suggestion that it is an error; it might have been better to
  enter it under <i>determinison</i> (or <i><span
  class="nw">-eson</span></i>); but it is always difficult to know how to
  deal with these mistakes of printers and editors.</p>

  more; see his former allusion in bk. i. prologue, 110. The reference is
  to bk. iii. pr. 10. 153-84.</p>

  <p>53. <i>apeted to</i>, sought after, longed for, desired. <i>Apete</i>
  is a correct form, as it represents an O.F. <i>*apeter</i>; but the usual
  O.F. form is <i>appeter</i> (Littré, s.v. <i>appéter</i>), from Lat.
  <i>appetere</i>. See New E. Dict., s.v. <i>Appete</i>, where a quotation
  is given from Chaucer, L. G. W. 1582. <!-- Page 477 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page477"></a>[477]</span>But the right reading
  in that line is surely <i>appetyteth</i>, as <i>appeteth</i> will not
  scan; unless we strongly accent the initial <i>As</i>. See vol. ii. p.
  137, l. 1582 and footnote, and the note to the line, at p. 328.</p>

  <p>56. <i>This</i> stands for <i>This is</i>, as usual; see notes to C.
  T., A 1091, E 56.</p>

  <p>71. <i>betterer</i>, better; not necessarily a misprint. The form
  <i>bettyrer</i> occurs in the Catholicon Anglicum.</p>

  <p>72. <i>his kyndely place</i>, its natural position; cf. Ch. Boeth. bk.

  <p>77. <i>blacke</i>; cf. Troil. i. 642.</p>

  <p>82. <i>yeven by the ayre</i>, endowed by the air with little goodness
  and virtue; because the dew that produced the pearl fell through the air;
  see note to ch. xii. 47 above. Hence <i>matier</i> is material, viz. the
  dew.</p>

  Dict., we find: '<i>fig.</i> an expression of regret at the loss or
  departure of anything; or a mere exclamatory recognition of its
  disappearance; = away, no longer, no more, all is over with. <i>c.</i>
  1400 <i>Test. Love</i> ii. (1560) 292/1. Adewe and adewe blis.'</p>

  <p>Something has gone wrong here; the edition of 1561 (not 1560) has, at
  fol. 306, back (not 292) the reading 'a dewe and a deblis'; as in the
  text. The same reading occurs in all the earlier black-letter editions
  and in Chalmers; there being no other authority except Thynne. I do not
  understand the passage; the apparent sense is: 'his name is given <i>a
  dieu</i> and to devils'; i.e. (I suppose) is renounced. <i>Deblis</i> for
  'devils' is a possible form; at any rate, we find <i>deblet</i>,
  <i>deblerie</i>, for <i>devilet</i> and <i>diablerie</i>; see New E.
  Dict., under <i>Dablet</i> and <i>Deblerie</i>.</p>

  <p>115-6. 'That which is good, seems to me to be wholly good.' This is
  extremely significant. 'The church is good, and therefore wholly good,'
  is evidently intended. In other words, it needs no reform; the Lollards
  should let it alone. In ch. 14. 24, he plainly speaks of 'heretics,' and
  of the errors of 'mismeninge people.'</p>

  <p>130. <i>leve</i>, believe. L. 120 shews that he hopes for mercy and
  pity; we may safely conclude that he had been a Lollard once. Cf. ch. 14.
  2-4.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. XIV.</b> 6. <i>Proverbes</i>. He refers to Prov. vii. 7-22:
  'Considero uecordem iuuenem, qui ... graditur in obscuro, in noctis
  tenebris; et ecce occurrit illi mulier ornatu meretricio, praeparata ad
  capiendas animas, garrula et uaga, quietis impatiens ... dicens ... ueni,
  inebriemur uberibus, et fruamur cupitis amplexibus ... statim eam
  sequitur quasi bos ductus ad uictimam.'</p>

  <p>25. <i>skleren and wimplen</i>, veil and cover over. He probably found
  <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>[478]</span>the word <i>skleire</i>, a veil, in P.
  Plowman, C. ix. 5 (cf. also B. vi. 7, A. vii. 7), as that is the only
  known example of the substantive. The verb occurs here only. Other
  spellings of <i>skleire</i>, sb., in the MSS., are <i>sklayre</i>,
  <i>scleyre</i>, <i>slaire</i>, <i>skleir</i>, <i>sleire</i>,
  <i>sleyre</i>. Cf. Du. <i>sluier</i>, G. <i>Schleier</i>.</p>

  <p>29. <i>by experience</i>; i.e. the author had himself been inclined to
  'heresy'; he was even in danger of 'never returning' (l. 38).</p>

  <p>36. <i>weyved</i>, rejected; he had rejected temptations to
  Lollardry.</p>

  <p>38. <i>shewed thee thy Margarite</i>; meaning (I suppose) shewn thee
  the excellence of the church as it is.</p>

  <p>40. <i>Siloë</i>, Siloam. It is a wonder where the author found this
  description of the waters of the pool of Siloam; but I much suspect that
  it arose from a gross misunderstanding of Isaiah, viii. 6, 7,
  thus:&mdash;'the waters of Shiloah that go softly ... shall come up over
  all his channels, and go over all his banks.' In the Vulgate: 'aquas
  Siloë, quae uadunt cum silentio ... ascendet super omnes riuos eius, et
  fluet super uniuersas ripas eius.' Hence <i>cankes</i> in l. 44 is
  certainly an error for <i>bankes</i>; the initial <i>c</i> was caught
  from the preceding <i>circuit</i>.</p>

  <p>46. After <i>Mercurius</i> supply <i>servaunts</i> or <i>children</i>.
  The children or servants of Mercury mean the clerks or writers. The
  expression is taken from Ch. C. T., D 697:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Chap. I.</b> This chapter is really a Prologue to the Third
  Book.</p>

  <p>2. <i>discrete</i>, separate; <i>tellinge</i>, counting.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Three</i> was considered a perfect number; see below.</p>

  <p>6. Time was divided into three ages; first, the age of Error, before
  the coming of Christ; all that died then went to hell, whence some <!--
  Page 479 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page479"></a>[479]</span>were
  rescued by Christ when He descended thither. The second, the age of
  Grace, from the time of Christ's coming till His second advent. The
  third, the age of Joy, enduring for ever in heaven.</p>

  <p><i>Deviacion</i>; Thynne prints <i>Demacion</i>, an obvious error for
  <i>Deuiacion</i> (<i>m</i> for <i>ui</i>); in l. 26, it is replaced by
  <i>Errour of misgoinge</i>, which has the same sense, and in bk. ii. ch.
  8. 126, it is called <i>out-waye-going</i>. The New E. Dict. has no
  quotation for <i>deviation</i> older than 1603; but here we find it.</p>

  <p>25. I. e. Book I treats of Error or Deviation; Book II, of Grace; and
  Book III, of Joy.</p>

  <p>28. <i>whiche is faylinge without desert</i>, which is failure without
  merit; these words are out of place here, and perhaps belong to the
  preceding clause (after <i>shewed</i> in l. 26). <i>thilke</i>, &amp;c.;
  amending that first fault.</p>

  <p>29. Perhaps for <i>and</i> read <i>an</i>; it refers to guidance into
  the right path.</p>

  <p>37. He says that the English alter the name <i>Margarite-perle</i>
  into <i>Margery-perle</i>, whereas Latin, French, and many other
  languages keep the true form. Cf. Lat. <i>margarita</i>, O.F.
  <i>marguerite</i>, <i>margarete</i>, Gk. <span title="margaritês" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F77;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>,
  Pers. <i>marw&#x101;r&#x12B;d</i>, Arab. <i>marj&#x101;n</i>; all from
  Skt. <i>manjar&#x12B;</i>, a pearl.</p>

  <p>45. <i>the more Britayne</i>, greater Britain (England and Scotland),
  as distinguished from lesser Britain (Brittany); see note to bk. ii. ch.
  12. 47 above. Pliny says (tr. by Holland, bk. ix. c. 35):&mdash;'In
  Brittaine it is certain that some [pearls] do grow; but they be small,
  dim of colour, and nothing orient.'</p>

  <p>56. <i>conninge</i>, certain knowledge; <i>opinion</i>, uncertain
  knowledge, supposition; as he proceeds to say.</p>

  <p>62. We thus learn that it was at this date an open question, whether
  the sun was bigger than the earth; there were some who imagined it to be
  so.</p>

  <p>68. He here mentions the <i>quadrivium</i>, or group of four of the
  seven sciences, viz. arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy; see note
  to P. Plowman, C. xii. 98.</p>

  <p>73. These are the four cardinal virtues, Prudence, Justice,
  Temperance, and Fortitude; see note to P. Plowman, C. i. 131.</p>

  <p>79. Why 'two things' are mentioned, is not clear. It was usual to
  introduce here the <i>trivium</i>, or second group of the seven arts (see
  note to l. 68); which contained logic, grammar, and rhetoric. For the two
  former he has substituted 'art,' the general term.</p>

  <p>99. <i>twey</i>, two; viz. <i>natural</i> and <i>reasonable</i>; cf.
  l. 53. The third is <i>moral</i>. Hence we have the following scheme.</p>

  <p>122. I. e. 'so that harm, (as punishment) for harm, should restrain
  evil-doers by the bridle of fear.'</p>

  <p>125. <i>contrarioustee of</i>, that which is contrary to.</p>

  <p>130. <i>and unworthy</i>, even if they be unworthy.</p>

  <p><i>professe and reguler</i>; the 'professed' were such as, after a
  year of probation, had been received into a monastic order; the 'regular'
  were such as were bound by the three monastic vows of poverty, chastity,
  and obedience.</p>

  <p>131. <i>obediencer</i>, bound by obedience; used adjectivally; cf. Low
  Lat. <i>obedientiarius</i>.</p>

  <p>134. Thus the author was himself bound by monastic vows, and was one
  of the 'regular' clergy.</p>

  <p>146-7. <i>abouten</i>, about (me), near at hand. <i>eche</i>, to
  increase, lengthen.</p>

  <p>156. <i>refrete</i>, refrain, burden of a song; O.F. <i>refrait</i>,
  <i>refret</i> (Godefroy). 'Sobs are a ready (ever-present) refrain in its
  meditations'; where <i>his</i> (its) refers to <i>goost</i>, or spirit,
  in l. 155.</p>

  <p>157-8. <i>comming about I not than</i>, recurring I know not when. For
  <i>than</i> read <i>whan</i>, to make sense.</p>

  <p>160. <i>he</i>, Christ; referring to Matt. xxi. 16.</p>

  <p>161. <i>whos spirit</i>; 'Spiritus ubi uult spirat'; John, iii. 8;
  'Spiritus, diuidens singulis prout uult'; 1 Cor. xii. 11.</p>

  <p>170. <i>wyte that</i>, lay the blame for that upon. Such is the right
  idiom; cf. 'Wyte it the ale of Southwerk, I yow preye'; Ch. C. T., A
  3140. Thynne prints <i>with</i> for <i>wite</i> or <i>wyte</i>, making
  nonsense of the passage.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. II.</b> 14. <i>lybel of departicion</i>, bill (or writ) of
  separation; taken from <i>libellum repudii</i> in Matt. v. 31, which
  Wyclif translates by 'a libel of forsakyng.'</p>

  <p>16. 'I find, in no law, (provision for) recompensing and rewarding in
  a bounteous way, those who are guilty, according to their deserts.'</p>

  <p>19. <i>Paulyn</i>, Paulinus. But there is some mistake. Perhaps he
  refers to L. Aemilius Paulus, brother of M. Aemilius Lepidus the
  Triumvir. This Paulus was once a determined enemy of Caesar, but was won
  over to his side by a large bribe.</p>

  <p>21-3. I cannot explain or understand this clause; something seems to
  be omitted, to which it refers.</p>

  <p>23. Julius Caesar was accounted as following Cato in justice. The
  statement is obscure.</p>

  <p>25. Perdiccas, according to the romances, succeeded Alexander the
  Great; see note to Bk. ii. c. 2. 116. I do not find the anecdote
  referring to Porus. It is not improbable that the author was thinking of
  Philip the physician, who revealed to Alexander 'a privy hate'
  entertained against that monarch by Parmenion; see the Wars of Alexander,
  ed. Skeat, 2559-83.</p>

  <p>49. <i>right as mater</i>. Cf. 'sicut ad formam de forma procedere
  materiam notum est'; an often quoted passage in Guido delle <!-- Page 481
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page481"></a>[481]</span>Colonne's
  Historia Troiae; see note to Legend of Good Women, 1582 (vol. iii. p.
  329).</p>

  <p>65. <i>and right</i>, if right-doing were not in the original
  working.</p>

  <p>82. <i>muste do good nedes</i>, must necessarily do good.</p>

  <p>87. <i>ende</i>, object. The reference seems to be to Aristotle,
  Nicomachean Ethics, bk. i. c. 1, c. 2, or c. 5.</p>

  <p>90. <i>goodly</i>, with a good motive. In l. 99, it simply means 'a
  good motive.'</p>

  <p>112. <i>praysing ne lacking</i>, praise nor blame.</p>

  <p>115. The Latin would be <i>nemo inuite beatus</i>; but I do not know
  where to find it.</p>

  <p>128. <i>free arbitrement</i>, Lat. liberum arbitrium; introduced in
  order to lead up to a discussion of free will, necessity, and providence;
  as in Boeth. bk. v.</p>

  <p>140. <i>closing</i>, including, implying.</p>

  <p>154-60. Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. v. pr. 3. 1-18.</p>

  <p>58. <i>for I love</i>, i.e. because (or since) I love.</p>

  <p>74. <i>commende</i>, coming; probably the original MS. had
  <i>command</i>, the Northern form. We have a similar form <i>lykende</i>,
  in l. 133 below. In ll. 82, 83, the usual form <i>comming</i>
  appears.</p>

  <p>82-3. In many places, <i>comming</i> is used nearly with the sense of
  'future'; cf. ll. 177-8.</p>

  <p>126. Here again we have the usual ridiculous contradictions; the sense
  is&mdash;'being wet, I burn; without wasting, I fade.' Cf. Rom. Rose,
  Eng. version, 4703-50.</p>

  <p>128. Thynne has (here and in ch. 6. 147, p. 132) <i>vnbyde</i>, an
  obvious error for <i>onbyde</i>, i.e. abide, remain; see ch. 7. 161,
  163.</p>

  <p>131. 'God grant (that) that thing may soon draw nigh to thee.'
  <i>Neigh</i> is here a verb, as in Bk. ii. ch. 12. 14.</p>

  <p>164. <i>that</i>, that which; <i>with nothing</i>, yet not so as to be
  constrained by anything else.</p>

  <p>171. <i>rysinge of the sonne</i>, rising of the sun; this example is
  borrowed from Ch. Boeth. bk. v. pr. 6. 103, 165.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. IV.</b> Cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. v. pr. 6. 157-89.</p>

  desire (a thing), he may also <i>not</i> desire (it)'; otherwise, he does
  not make any choice.</p>

  <p>30-1. The words 'But thilke ... the same to wilne' are <i>repeated</i>
  in Thynne's edition, to the destruction of the sense.</p>

  <p>59. <i>as now</i>, present; cf. Boeth. bk. v. pr. 6. 28-32.</p>

  <p>96-9. A clear case of reasoning in a circle.</p>

  <p>112. 'Constituisti terminos eius, qui praeteriri non poterunt'; Job,
  xiv. 5.</p>

  <p>121-6. See Rom. viii. 29, 30. <i>conformes</i>; the Vulgate has: 'Nam

  <p>169. <i>by</i>, with reference to.</p>

  <p>198-9. <i>no art</i>, in no way (?); but surely an error for
  <i>nat</i>, as <i>wrytest nat</i> is repeated in l. 200.</p>

  <p>206. <i>defendeth</i>, 'forbids something to be movable,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>220. Too obscure to deserve the encomium for perspicuity which follows
  in ll. 222-5.</p>

  <p>232. <i>for right</i>, &amp;c.; 'for nothing at all exists there (i.e.
  in eternity) after the manner of that which is temporal.'</p>

  <p>243. <i>ben to ben</i>, are to come because of God's knowledge.</p>

  <p>249. <i>philosophical poete</i>; Chaucer, because he translated The
  Consolation of Philosophy, and introduced passages from it into his poem
  of Troilus, notably in Book iv. 963-6, 974-1078. In l. 254, Troilus is
  expressly mentioned. Most likely, the allusion is to Bk. iv. 974-1078;
  although this deals rather with predestination than with the origin of
  evil.</p>

  <p>257. <i>storiers</i>, gen. pl. of <i>storier</i>, a teller of a story;
  cf. O.F. <i>historieur</i>, an historian (Godefroy). Thynne prints
  <i>starieres</i>; which gives no sense.</p>

  <p>262. <i>two the laste</i>, the last two; chapters 13 and 14; but
  chapter 14 has little to do with the subject.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. V.</b> 4. 'Or as an ook comth of a litel spyr'; Troil. ii.
  1335.</p>

  <p>33-7. The word <i>welked</i> occurs twice in Chaucer, C. T., C 738, D
  277; and <i>wiver</i> once, Troil. iii. 1010.</p>

  <p>57. <i>with yvel ... acomered</i>, desires not to be encumbered with
  evil.</p>

  <p>63. 'Why, as soon as one has sprung up on high, does not the other
  spring up also?' Here 'one' and 'the other' seem to refer to 'will' and
  'bliss'; cf. ll. 16, 17, 70, 71.</p>

  <p>73-6. Cf. HF. 737-46; Boeth. bk. iii. pr. 11. 98-101.</p>

  <p>60. <i>aptes</i>, natural tendencies; used here only; see New E.
  Dict.</p>

  <p>64. <i>terme of equivocas</i>, terms of like signification;
  <i>terme</i> being an error for <i>termes</i>. Answering to Lat. <i>uerba
  aequiuoca</i>, words of like signification; Isidore, Orig. ii. 26 (Lewis
  and Short). <i>Equivocas</i> is formed by adding the Eng. pl. <i><span
  class="nw">-s</span></i> to the Lat. neuter plural (New E. Dict.).</p>

  <p>Cf. the passage in P. Plowman, where <i>Liberum-arbitrium</i> recites

  <p>104. Thynne has <i>vs</i>, which is a not uncommon spelling of 'use.'
  I merely print 'us[e]' because <i>us</i> looks so unintelligible. In l.

  <i>cor-hominis</i>, the heart of man. In P. Plowman, the tree is called
  True-love, the blossoms are Benign-Speech (cf. l. 16), and the fruits are
  deeds of Charity. See note to l. 69 below.</p>

  related to something else as forming part of a sentence.</p>

  <p>69. So in P. Plowman, C. xix. 29, the tree is attacked by three wicked
  winds; especially 'in flouryng-tyme,' l. 35.</p>

  <p>97. <i>A marchaunt</i>; so in Chaucer, C. T., G 945-50.</p>

  <p>99. <i>So ofte</i>; from Ch. Troil. ii. 1380-3; note the epithet
  <i>happy</i>, the use of the sb. <i>sweigh</i> or <i>swaye</i>, and the
  phrase <i>come al at ones</i>, in both passages.</p>

  <p>101. Cf. 'Gutta cauat lapidem'; Ovid, Ex Ponto, iv. 10. 5.</p>

  <p><i>lethy</i>, weak; see Prompt. Parv., and Gloss. to P. Plowman.</p>

  <p>117-121. Compare Bk. iii. ch. 2. 122-9.</p>

  <p>123. 'Quod debuimus facere, fecimus'; Luke, xvii. 10.</p>

  <p>145. <i>al is</i>, it is all to be accounted to her wholly. <i>To
  wyte</i> usually has a bad sense; as implying blame.</p>

  <p>160. <i>this lady</i>; i.e. Heavenly Love suddenly took up its place
  in his heart. This is rather inartistic; no wonder that the author was
  much astonished at such a proceeding (ch. 8. 2 below). This of course
  puts an end to the dialogue, but in Thynne's misarranged print the lady
  speaks to him again, as if it were <i>out of his heart</i>!</p>

  <p><b>Chap. VIII.</b> 7. <i>lynes</i>, written lines of writing, which he
  imagines to be imprinted on his understanding; see ll. 8, 13, 14
  below.</p>

  <p>10. <i>me might</i>, one might; <i>me</i> for <i>men</i> = <i>man</i>,
  as often. <!-- Page 484 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page484"></a>[484]</span></p>

  <p>21. <i>but for</i>, except because; so in l. 22. <i>wol</i>,
  desires.</p>

  <p>42. <i>owe I not alowe</i>, I ought not to applaud.</p>

  <p>46. <i>it make</i>, cause it (to be so); as in Troil. ii. 959.</p>

  <p>91. 'Quia Christi bonus odor sumus Deo, in iis qui salui fiunt; ...
  aliis quidem odor mortis in mortem'; 2 Cor. ii. 15-6.</p>

  <p>120. <i>ne had</i>, had; disregarding <i>ne</i>, which is inserted
  after the word <i>denyed</i>.</p>

  <p>123. <i>without ... nede</i>, without any kind of necessity.</p>

  <p>125. <i>him nedeth</i>, something is lacking to him.</p>

  <p>146. <i>forward</i>, thenceforward, afterwards.</p>

  <p>155-6. <i>in his owne comodité</i>, in what is suitable for him;
  <i>comodites</i>, desires that are suitable. The examples of the word in
  this passage are older than any given, s.v. <i>Commodity</i>, in the New
  E. Dict. Cf. ll. 159, 165.</p>

  <p><b>Chap. IX.</b> 7. <i>destenee</i>, destiny; cf. Ch. Boeth. bk. iv.
  pr. 6. 39, 44.</p>

  <p>12. <i>non inconvenient</i>, convenient; i.e. befitting.</p>

  <p>21. <i>chapitre</i>, chapter; viz. ch. 3 of Book iii.</p>

  <p>46. Here Thynne's text returns to the right order.</p>

  <p>52. The author now concludes his work with a prayer and a short
  recommendation of his book to the reader. Ll. 58-61 speak of its
  imperfections; ll. 61-6 tell us that the effort of writing it has done
  him good. In ll. 67-75 he anticipates future freedom from anxiety, and
  continuance 'in good plight.' He was then evidently unaware that his
  death was near at hand.</p>

  <p>86. 'My dull wit is hindred by the stepmother named Forgetfulness.' A
  curious expression.</p>

  <p>92. <i>horisons</i>, put for <i>orisons</i>, prayers.</p>

  <p>98. <i>sightful</i>, visible; an obvious allusion to the eucharist (l.
  100). Similarly, a gem denotes a pearl, or 'margaret'; and Margaret (a
  woman's name) denotes grace, learning, or wisdom of God, or else holy
  church.</p>

  <p>104. From John, vi. 63.</p>

  <p>107. From 2 Cor. iii. 6.</p>

  <p>109, 110. Printed as prose in Thynne; but two riming verses seem to be
  intended. If so, <i>al-le</i> is dissyllabic.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece2">II. THE PLOWMAN'S TALE.</a></p>

  <p>Numerous references are given to Pierce the Ploughman's Crede, ed.
  Skeat (E.E.T.S.); a poem by the same author. See the Introduction.</p>

  <p>9. <i>tabard</i>; a ploughman's loose frock; as in Ch. C. T., A
  541.</p>

  <p>11. <i>saynt Thomas</i>; i.e. his shrine at Canterbury.</p>

  <p>30. <i>therwith to fynd</i>, to provide for thereby.</p>

  <p>40. <i>queynt</i>, quenched; because, in the solemn form of
  excommunication used in the Romish church, a bell was tolled, the book of
  offices <!-- Page 485 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page485"></a>[485]</span>for the purpose was used, and three
  candles were extinguished. See Nares, s.v. <i>Bell, Book, and Candle</i>.
  Cf. ll. 165, 1241.</p>

  <p>44. Four lines are here lost, the stanza being incomplete. We might
  supply them thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>They have the loof and we the crust,</p>
      <p>They eten more than kinde hath craved;</p>
      <p>They been ungentle and unjust,</p>
      <p>With sinners shullen such be graved.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>53. <i>stryf</i>, strife. The struggle was between the secular and
  regular clergy on the one hand, and the Lollards on the other; see ll.
  61-76. Each side accused the other of falseness, and the author hopes
  that the falser of them may suffer shame. He evidently sides with the
  Lollards; but, not caring to decide so weighty a question for himself, he
  contrives that the dispute shall be carried on by two birds, the Griffin
  and the Pelican.</p>

  <p>55. <i>sedes</i>, seeds. The Lollards were accused of sowing tares
  (<i>lolia</i>). The author hints that seeds were sown by <i>both</i> of
  the contending parties.</p>

  <p>57. <i>some</i>; referring rather to the sowers than to the seeds. In
  any case, it refers to the two parties.</p>

  <p>58. <i>souple</i>; the text has <i>souble</i>, which is an obvious
  error. The O.F. <i>souple</i> means 'humble,' which is the sense here
  intended.</p>

  <p>71. <i>a-cale</i>, chilled, frozen; cf. note to P. Plowman, C. xxi.
  439; and see the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>72. <i>ever in oon</i>, always in the same condition, without
  increasing in wealth.</p>

  <p>73. <i>I-cleped</i>, called; the old text has <i>Iclepeth</i>, but
  some editions make this obvious correction. <i>lollers</i>, idle fellows;
  see the note to P. Plowman, C. x. 213.</p>

  <p>74. 'Whoever looks on them (sees that) they are the reverse of tall.'
  Cf. 'a <i>tall</i> fellow,' and 'a <i>tall</i> man of his hands' in
  Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>81. <i>wro</i>, nook; see <i>wr&#x101;</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>86. <i>Griffon</i>, griffin; a fabulous monster with the head and
  wings of an eagle, and the hinder parts of a lion; with probable
  reference to the Vulture. 'In that contre ben many <i>griffounes</i> ...
  thei han the body upward as an egle, and benethe as a lyoun.... But o
  griffoun is more strong thanne .viij. lyouns'; Mandeville's Travels; ch.
  xxvi. See l. 1317 below.</p>

  <p>87. 'A Pelican laid his lure to (attracted to him) these lollers.' The
  Pelican was supposed to feed its young with blood which it drew from its
  own breast by wounding it, and was early considered as the type of
  Christian love or Charity, or of Christ himself; see l. 1293. See the
  illustration at p. 172 of Legends of the Holy Rood, ed. Morris. Hence it
  is here supposed to plead on behalf of meekness, in the long passages
  contained in ll. 95-716, 719-988, 991-1072, 1110-32, 1177-232, 1245-68.
  The Pelican is responsible for the greater part of the <!-- Page 486
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page486"></a>[486]</span>poem, as the
  author distinctly says in l. 1373. Anything that is amiss, we are told,
  must be put down to the Pelican; the author is irresponsible, as it is
  only a fable.</p>

  <p>106. <i>pelure</i>, costly fur; also spelt <i>pellour</i>; but
  <i>pylloure</i> (as in the old text) is a bad spelling. See Gloss. to P.
  Plowman.</p>

  <p>111. <i>batail</i>, battle. It was notorious that William Spenser,
  bishop of Norwich, used to lead military expeditions. Thus he led one
  such expedition into Flanders, in 1382. Cf. l. 128.</p>

  <p>129. 'God is not the master of them that consider no man equal to
  them.'</p>

  <p>130. <i>peragall</i>, equal; spelt 'p<i>er</i>agal' or
  'p<i>ar</i>agal' in Rich. the Redeless, i. 71. The old text has
  <i>permagall</i>, where the <i>m</i> is clearly for <i>in</i>; the
  spelling <i>peringall</i> being intended. Godefroy has O.F.
  <i>parivel</i>, also <i>parigal</i>, <i>paregal</i>, <i>perigal</i>,
  <i>paringal</i> [with intrusive <i>n</i>], 'adj. et s., tout à fait ègal,
  tout à fait semblable.' From Lat. <i>peraequalis</i>.</p>

  <p>135. 'Painted and adorned with colours.' Cf. 'peynt and portred'; P.
  Pl. Crede, 192; 'portreid and paynt,' 121.</p>

  <p>139. <i>boystous</i>, rough. The O.F. <i>boistous</i> meant 'lame' (F.
  <i>boiteux</i>); but Godefroy shews, in his Supplement, that it was also
  applied to a very rough road (as being likely to lame one); hence,
  generally, rough, and finally, rude, noisy, as in the E.
  <i>boisterous</i>; a word of which the etymology has not yet been fully
  accounted for, but may be thus explained.</p>

  <p>159. <i>perrey</i>, precious stones, jewellery; see <i>Perree</i> in
  the Glossary (vol. vi). The old text has <i>pyrrey</i>.</p>

  <p>162. <i>gown</i>, an obvious correction; old text, <i>gold</i>,
  repeated from l. 161. For 'grene gownes,' see l. 925 below.</p>

  <p>178. This line seems to be corrupt.</p>

  <p>186. <i>crallit</i>, curled, twisted; cf. <i>crulle</i> in Chaucer;
  see New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>187. <i>gold-mastling</i> is a compound word, and should have been
  printed with a hyphen. It means the same as <i>latoun</i>, unless
  <i>latoun</i> was an imitation of an older and richer alloy. Thus, in
  Wright's A.S. Vocabularies, we find: '<i>Auricalcum</i>, goldmæslinc,'
  col. 334, 10; '<i>Auricalcum</i>, goldmestling,' col. 550, 34;
  '<i>Auricalcum</i>, <i>Anglice</i> latoun,' col. 567, 5. As to
  <i>latoun</i>, see note in vol. v. p. 270. Cf. A.S. <i>mæstling</i>, G.
  <i>Messing</i>; words of uncertain origin.</p>

  <p>193-4. Cf. 1 John, iv. 3. <i>admirall</i>, prince, chief.</p>

  <p>198. <i>demed</i>; an easy correction; old text, <i>done</i>, which
  will not scan.</p>

  <p>201. <i>All-holyest</i>, i.e. <i>Sanctissimus</i> (l. 230); a title
  given to the head of a religious order.</p>

  <p>208. 'The very thing which Christ forbad to the apostles.'</p>

  <p>212. 'They regard him (the pope) as wholly omnipotent.'</p>

  <p>213-6. <i>He</i>, the Pope. <i>another</i>, (apparently) a head of a
  religious order, an abbot or prior. <i>mystere</i>, ministry, office.</p>

  <p>220. 'He reserves nothing at all'; <i>opin</i>, open, a thing that is
  free; <i>joint</i>, a thing that is connected. <!-- Page 487 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page487"></a>[487]</span></p>

  <p>226. <i>An angell</i>; see Rev. xxii. 9.</p>

  <p>235. Read <i>Christ his</i>; 'Christ keep his people from them'; the
  printer evidently regarded <i>Christ his</i> as a form of the genitive
  case. The proper sense of <i>wisse</i> is guide, or direct.</p>

  <p>242. <i>which of hem</i>, which of the two popes. The rival popes were
  Boniface IX, elected Nov. 2, 1389, and Benedict XIII, elected Sept. 28,
  1394. Clement VIII, predecessor of the latter, died Sept. 16, 1394.</p>

  <p>245. 'Omnes enim, qui acceperint gladium, gladio peribunt'; Matt.
  xxvi. 52.</p>

  <p>255. Swearing was a dismembering of Christ; see note to C. T., C 474
  (vol. v. p. 275).</p>

  <p>264. 'But curse all that oppose them.'</p>

  <p>275. 'But he, who so acquires it, shall part from it.'</p>

  <p>281. <i>rent</i>, income, profit; the method of doing this is
  explained in The Freres Tale, D 1371-4.</p>

  <p>282. 'They anoint the sheep's sore'; as a shepherd does with tar; see
  <i>Tar-box</i> in Halliwell; and cf. l. 707.</p>

  <p>298. <i>Maximien</i>; Galerius Valerius Maximianus, usually called
  Galerius; emperor of Rome, 305-11; a cruel persecutor of the
  Christians.</p>

  <p>297. 'They follow Christ (who went upward) to heaven, just as a bucket
  (that goes downward) into a well.' Said ironically; their ascent towards
  heaven is in a downward direction; cf. l. 402. <i>wall</i> for 'well' is
  rare, but not unexampled; cf. <i>walle-stream</i>, well-stream, in
  Layamon, vol. i. p. 121, and see <i>walle</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>305. 'The truth has (often) slain such men.'</p>

  <p>306. 'They comb their "crockets" with a crystal comb.' A
  <i>crocket</i> was a curl or roll of hair, as formerly worn; see the New
  E. Dict. There is a lost romance entitled 'King Adelstane with gilden
  kroket'; see footnote to Havelok, ed. Skeat, p. vi. Sir F. Madden remarks
  that 'the term <i>crocket</i> points out the period [i.e. the earliest
  possible date] of the poem's composition, since the fashion of wearing
  those large rolls of hair so called, only arose at the latter end of the
  reign of Henry III.'</p>

  <p>321. Cf. 'turpis lucri'; Tit. i. 7, 11; 1 Pet. v. 2.</p>

  <p>322. <i>meynall</i>, perhaps better spelt <i>meyneall</i>. It is the
  adj. formed from M.E. <i>meynee</i>, a household, and is the same word as
  mod. E. <i>menial</i>. Wyclif uses <i>meyneal</i> to translate Lat.
  <i>domesticam</i> in Rom. xvi. 5. The sense here is&mdash;the exaction of
  tithes is, with these masters, a household business, a part of their
  usual domestic arrangements.</p>

  <p>325. Lit. 'They betake to farm to their sumners,' i.e. they farm out
  to their sumners the power of harming people as much as they can; they
  let their sumners make exactions. The method of doing this is fully
  exposed in Chaucer's Freres Tale. Cf. ll. 328, 725.</p>

  <p>333. 'Such rascals are sure to slander men, in order to induce them to
  win their favour'; i.e. by compounding.</p>

  <p>338. <i>call</i>, caul or head-dress, richly ornamented, and therefore
  expensive; see note to C. T., D 1018 (vol. v. p. 318). <!-- Page 488
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page488"></a>[488]</span></p>

  <p>375. 'Or, to commit such a tool (instrument) to such cursed men.'</p>

  <p>402. 'As good a bishop as is my horse Ball.' Said ironically; 'no
  better a bishop than,' &amp;c. Ball was, and still is, a very common name
  for a horse.</p>

  <p>406. <i>nothing</i>, not at all, not a whit.</p>

  <p>410. Old text, <i>one fors</i>, with <i>s</i> attached to the wrong
  word.</p>

  <p>417-8. <i>goodes</i>, property. <i>somme totall</i>, sum total of
  wealth.</p>

  <p>421, 431. <i>for Christes love</i>, for love of Christ. The words
  <i>forsake</i> in l. 421, and <i>wake</i> in l. 431, are used
  ironically.</p>

  <p>434. <i>Lamuall</i>, Lemuel; who was a king; Prov. xxxi. 1.</p>

  <p>443. <i>the stoon</i>, the rock; Matt. xvi. 18; cf. 1 Cor. x. 4.</p>

  <p>445. <i>croysery</i>, crusade, as in Rob. of Glouc. 9938. No serious
  crusade was intended at this time; however, the author affirms that the
  rival popes discouraged the idea; for each wanted men to fight for
  him.</p>

  <p>464. <i>hye seet</i>, sat aloft; the form <i>seet</i> occurs in Ch. C.
  T., A 2075.</p>

  <p>471. <i>fettes</i>, fetch; observe the use of this Northern
  plural.</p>

  <p>473. 'Their servants are unfaithful [or unserviceable] to them unless
  they can double their rental.'</p>

  <p>477. The author can find no more rimes to rime with <i>fall</i>, so he
  proceeds to 'shew' or propose another word, viz. <i>amend</i>.</p>

  <p>487. 'They tell men nothing, nor (explain) how; yet, in God's word,
  they tell of (or count) many a slip, or omission,' i.e. find errors in
  the Scriptures. See <i>Balk</i> in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>490. <i>offrend</i>; O.F. <i>offrende</i>; cf. '<i>Offrande</i>, an
  offering'; Cotgrave.</p>

  <p>520. Read <i>punishëments</i>, as in the old edition; it is a word of
  four syllables; from O.F. <i>punissement</i> (Godefroy), which often
  appears in verse as a word of four syllables.</p>

  <p>531. 'They hate guests of the poor,' i.e. hate to entertain them; cf.
  l. 747.</p>

  <p>542. <i>careckes</i>, characters, signs, marks; see the New E.
  Dict.</p>

  <p>567. 'One, to curse to hell; the other, to slay men here (on earth)';
  cf. Luke, xxii. 38.</p>

  <p>575. 'A sword is no implement to guard sheep with, except for
  shepherds that would devour the sheep.' In later English, at any rate, a
  <i>sheep-biter</i> meant a thief (Halliwell). Cf. l. 583.</p>

  <p>594. <i>untrend</i>, unrolled; not rolled up, but freshly pulled
  off.</p>

  <p>605. <i>Sathan</i>, Satan; Heb. <i>s&#x101;t&#x101;n</i>, adversary,
  opponent.</p>

  <p>610. Read <i>reprende</i>; cf. <i>comprende</i> in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>625. <i>ensyse</i>, variant of <i>assyse</i>, fashion, sort; 'they
  are, surely, of the same sort.' See <i>Assize</i>, sect. 8, in the New E.
  Dict. Bailey gives: '<i>Ensise</i>, quality, stamp; <i>Old word</i>';
  with reference, doubtless, to this very line. Cf. <i>assyse</i>, fashion,
  manner, in l. 843 below.</p>

  <p>626. <i>frend</i>, evidently put for <i>fremde</i>, strange, foreign,
  averse; which was difficult to pronounce.</p>

  <p>633. Read <i>maundements</i>, i.e. commandments (trisyllabic). The
  form <!-- Page 489 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page489"></a>[489]</span><i>commaundementes</i> is too long for the
  line. See <i>mandement</i> in Stratmann and in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>642. <i>to prison</i>. Evidently written before 1401, when Lollards
  were frequently sent to the stake for heresy. Cf. l. 650; and see note to
  l. 827.</p>

  <p>645. 'The king's law will judge no man angrily, without allowing the
  accused to answer.'</p>

  <p>661. <i>testament</i>, a will; the friars had much to do with the
  making of wills.</p>

  <p>681. 'For they (the people) are faster in their bonds, worse beaten,
  and more bitterly burnt than is known to the king.' For the word
  <i>brent</i>, see note to l. 827.</p>

  <p>693. <i>The emperour</i>; Constantine, according to a legend which the
  Lollards loved to repeat; see the full note to P. Plowman, C. xviii.
  220.</p>

  <p>695. <i>sely kyme</i>, innocent (or silly) wretch. <i>Kyme</i> answers
  to an A.S. <i>*c&#x233;ma</i> = <i>*k&#x16B;m-ja</i>, lit. 'one who
  laments,' from the verb found in O.H.G. <i>k&#x16B;mjan</i>, to lament,
  <i>ch&#x16B;-mo</i>, a lament; cf. Gk. <span title="goos" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&#x1F79;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, wailing; Skt. <i>gu</i>, to
  sound. See O.H.G. <i>c&#x16B;m</i>, <i>c&#x16B;mjan</i> in Schade; and
  the Idg. root <i>gu</i>, in Fick.</p>

  <p>723. 'A title of dignity, to be as a play-mate to them'; a curious
  expression. Godefroy gives O.F. '<i>personage</i>, s.m., dignité,
  bénéfice ecclésiastique; en particulier personnat, dignité ecclésiastique
  qui donnait quelque prééminence au <i>chanoine</i> qui en était revêtu
  dans le chapitre auquel il appartenait.' Cotgrave has: '<i>Personat</i>,
  a place, or title of honour, enjoyed by a beneficed person, without any
  manner of jurisdiction, in the church.'</p>

  <p>724. Possibly copied from P. Plowman, B. prol. 92:&mdash;'Somme serven
  the king, and his silver tellen.' These ecclesiastics often busied
  themselves in the law-courts, to their great profit. Cf. l. 790.</p>

  <p>725. 'And let out to farm all that business.'</p>

  <p>743. <i>builde</i>; so in P. Pl. Crede, 118: 'For we buldeth a burwgh,
  a brod and a large.' Cf. Wyclif's Works, ed. Arnold, iii. 380.</p>

  <p>748. 'Nor (will they) send anything to Him who hath given them
  everything.'</p>

  <p>759. <i>gigges</i>, concubines; see Stratmann. Roquefort has:
  '<i>Gigues</i>, fille gaie, vive.' Cf. <i>giglot</i> in Shakespeare.
  (Initial <i>g</i> is here sounded as <i>j</i>.)</p>

  <p>760. 'And provide them with fine clothes.'</p>

  <p>773. Here all the 'seven sins' are mentioned except gluttony.</p>

  <p>780. 'The wisdom of such willers is not worth a needle.'</p>

  <p>791. <i>jay</i>; so also in Chaucer, C. T., A 642.</p>

  <p>801. <i>maynteyners</i>, abettors of wrongdoers; see note to P.
  Plowman, B. iii. 90.</p>

  <p>827. <i>brent</i>, burnt; still more strongly put in l. 1234. That
  heretics were sometimes burnt before 1401, is certain from Wyclif's
  Sermons, ed. Arnold, vol. i. pp. x, 205, as compared with p. 354. There
  is a case given in Bracton of a man who was burnt as early as in the
  reign of <!-- Page 490 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page490"></a>[490]</span>Henry III. See the whole subject discussed
  in my edition of P. Plowman (E. E. T. S.), in the Pref. to B-text, p. v,
  Pref. to C-text, pp. xi-xiv, and the note to B. xv. 81, where Langland
  has 'ledeth me to brennynge.' Observe that the king is here spoken of as
  not presuming to burn heretics.</p>

  <p>855. The seven sacraments of the Romish church; cf. l. 875.</p>

  <p>856. Compare&mdash;'And also y sey coveitise <i>catel to fongen</i>';
  P. Pl. Crede, 146.</p>

  <p>857. 'They want to meddle in everything, and to perform matters amiss
  is their amusement.'</p>

  <p>868. <i>sturte</i>, variant of <i>sterte</i>, start up; <i>stryve</i>,
  struggle.</p>

  <p>870. <i>at the nale</i> = <i>at then ale</i>, at the ale-house; cf.
  note to P. Plowman, C. i. 43.</p>

  <p>871. Cf. 'At marketts and miracles we medleth us nevere'; P. Pl.
  Crede, 107.</p>

  <p>872. 'They dance and hoot with the cry of "heave and hale."'
  <i>Heave</i> is here to use exertion; cf. Troil. ii. 1289; and
  <i>hale</i> is to haul or pull. <i>Heave and hale</i>, or <i>heave and
  hoe</i>, was a cry used for men to pull all together; hence <i>with heve
  and hale</i> just corresponds to the modern 'with might and main.'
  Cotgrave has (s.v. <i>Cor</i>) the phrase: '<i>À cor et à cry</i>, by
  proclamation; also, by might and maine, with heave and hoe, eagerly,
  vehemently, seriously.'</p>

  <p>878. <i>they</i>, i.e. the husbands; <i>sory</i>, aggrieved.</p>

  <p>880. <i>For</i>, for fear of being summoned.</p>

  <p>893. <i>stocke</i>, i.e. some image of a saint. An image of a
  favourite saint was honoured with many candles burning before it; whilst
  other saints were left in the dark, because they could work no miracles.
  The most favourite image was that of Mary; see l. 902, and cf. P. Pl.
  Crede, 79.</p>

  <p>915. 'And alle povere in gost god himself blisseth'; P. Pl. Crede,
  521.</p>

  <p>918. <i>Baudriks</i>, belts; <i>baselardes</i>, short swords,
  sometimes curved. See note to P. Plowman, C. iv. 461.</p>

  <p>927. <i>counten ... of gownes</i>, they think much (<i>counten</i>) of
  scarlet and green gowns, that must be made in the latest fashion, in
  order to embrace and kiss the damsels. An awkward sentence.</p>

  <p>929. <i>sewe</i>, sue, suit, lit. follow; unless it be for
  <i>schewe</i>, i.e. shew.</p>

  <p>930. <i>pykes</i>, peaks. Long-peaked shoes were much in fashion; cf.
  note to P. Plowman, C. xxiii. 219.</p>

  <p>941. 'Such men will ask them (i.e. those that confess to them) for
  money for shriving them.' <i>is</i> = <i>es</i>, them; a curious form of
  the plural pronoun of the third person; see <i>es</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>942. 'And they desire men to creep to the cross.' 'Creeping to the
  cross' was an old ceremony of penance, most practised on Good Friday; see
  note to P. Plowman, C. xxi. 475.</p>

  <p>943. <i>askes</i>, ashes; alluding to the sacrament of penance. For
  all other sacraments (as baptism, confirmation, holy orders, the
  eucharist, matrimony, and extreme unction) men had to pay. <!-- Page 491
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page491"></a>[491]</span></p>

  <p>955. <i>sans ... dyre</i>, without (saying) 'if I may say so.' That
  is, <i>ose je dyre</i>, (dare I say it) is an apologetic phrase for
  introducing an unpalatable remark.</p>

  <p>957. 'Either they give the bishops (some reason) why.'</p>

  <p>961. <i>agryse</i>, dread, here used in an imperative sense; 'let such
  men dread God's anger.' Cf. ll. 964, 1216.</p>

  <p>979. <i>for he</i>, because he would fain earn something.</p>

  <p>993. <i>Benet</i>, Benedict; cf. Ch. C. T., A 173, and note.</p>

  <p>1002. Cf. 'Of double worstede y-dight'; P. Pl. Crede, 228.</p>

  <p>1035. Compare&mdash;'And his syre a soutere' (cobbler); P. Pl. Crede,
  752.</p>

  <p>1042-4. <i>honged</i>, hung upon, followed after. Cf. 'opon the plow
  hongen,' P. Pl. Crede, 421. And compare also the same, 784-8.</p>

  <p>1050. The line is imperfect. I have supplied <i>but</i>, but the right
  word is <i>not</i>. For <i>cherelich</i> means 'expensive' or 'prodigal,'
  from O.F. <i>cher</i>, dear. This we know from the occurrence of the same
  rare form as an adverb in P. Pl. Crede, 582; where the sense
  is&mdash;'but to maintain his chamber as expensively (<i>chereliche</i>)
  as a chieftain.' See <i>cherely</i> in the New E. Dict. The parallel
  phrase <i>not lordlych</i> occurs in l. 1052.</p>

  <p>1066. <i>Crede</i>, i.e. Pierce the Ploughman's Crede, written shortly
  before by the same author, and describing at length the four orders of
  friars.</p>

  <p>1089. <i>sad</i>, sated, tired. The more usual old sense was
  'staid.'</p>

  <p>1097. 'If they were poor, filthy, and dirty.'</p>

  <p>1102. <i>honest</i>, honourable, worthy of respect; cf. l. 1105.</p>

  <p>1115. <i>Maysters</i>, masters; Matt. xxiii. 10. Cf. P. Pl. Crede,
  574-6, 838; and C. T., D 2185, and the note (vol. v. p. 340).</p>

  <p>1135. Read <i>leve</i>, not <i>lyve</i>; <i>with hir leve</i>, with
  what is permitted to them. For <i>leve</i> (leave), see l. 1238.</p>

  <p>1153. <i>For ye woll</i>, because you wish to.</p>

  <p>1166. <i>distaunce</i>, disagreement, strife; see Mätzner.</p>

  <p>1174. 'Why do ye meddle, who have nothing to do with it?'</p>

  <p>1189. <i>lette</i>, to prevent men from living in that way.</p>

  <p>1193. <i>soule-hele</i>, salvation for the soul.</p>

  <p>1200. Pronounce <i>this is</i> as <i>this</i>.</p>

  <p>1212. <i>Wedding</i>, matrimony; considered as a sacrament.</p>

  <p>1222. 'subject or accident'; cf. note to C. T., C 539.</p>

  <p>1231. The line should end with a semicolon.</p>

  <p>1244. 'Unless ye will act otherwise.'</p>

  <p>1271. <i>cockes</i>, euphemistic for <i>goddes</i>.</p>

  <p>1272. <i>doule</i>, small feather, down-feather. I derive it from O.F.
  <i>doulle</i>, variant of <i>douille</i>, soft, something soft, from Lat.
  <i>ductilis</i>. Hence it meant something downy, and, in particular, the
  'down-feather' of a bird. This is clearly the sense in Shakespeare also,
  where Ariel uses the expression&mdash;'one <i>dowle</i> that's in my
  plume'; Temp. iii. 3. 65; i.e. one down-feather (small feather) that is
  in my plumage. Dr. Schmidt is in doubt whether <i>plume</i> here means
  'plumage,' but the <!-- Page 492 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page492"></a>[492]</span>stage-direction expressly says that 'Ariel
  enters like a harpy, and claps his <i>wings</i> upon the table.' It is
  very interesting to see how well this passage illustrates Shakespeare.
  See Mr. Wright's note for other passages where <i>dowl</i> means 'soft
  down.' Of course, the words <i>dowl</i> and <i>down</i> are in no way
  connected. See my note in Phil. Soc. Trans. 1888-90, p. 3.</p>

  <p>1280. <i>God wolde</i>, i.e. oh! that it might be God's will. Cf.
  <i>would God</i>, Numb. xi. 29; Deut. xxviii. 67; 2 Kings, v. 3; Rich.
  II, iv. 1. 117.</p>

  <p>1293. Christ was likened to the pelican; see note to l. 87.</p>

  <p>1305. <i>The foul</i>, the former or <i>bird</i><span
  class="nw">-like</span> part of the griffin; see note to l. 86, and cf.
  l. 1317.</p>

  <p>1315. 'Because bribery may break God's prohibition.'</p>

  <p>1317. Referring to the form of the griffin; see notes to ll. 86,
  1305.</p>

  <p>1336. <i>Y-gurd</i>, lit. girt; hence, prepared, ready.</p>

  <p>1339. <i>ly</i>, lie, i.e. deceive; because the lapwing tries to
  delude those who search for its nest.</p>

  <p>1340. <i>for-gerd</i>, destroyed, utterly done away with; from M.E.
  <i>for-garen</i>.</p>

  <p>1343. <i>the Phenix</i>. The Ph&oelig;nix is here supposed, as being
  an unique bird, to be the king or master of all birds, and to execute
  vengeance on evil-doers.</p>

  <p>1359. The sense of <i>of</i> is here uncertain. Perhaps <i>of
  flight</i> means 'as regards my flight,' and so 'to protect my
  flight.'</p>

  <p>1361. This line is somewhat 'set back,' as in the original. But there
  seems to be no reason for it.</p>

  <p>1362. The original has: 'And the lambe that slayn was'; imperfect.</p>

  <p>1367. Here the author speaks for himself, and excuses the Pelican's
  language.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece3">III. JACK UPLAND.</a></p>

  <p>To this piece, which is an attack upon the friars, a reply was made by
  one of them (probably a Dominican, see notes to ll. 100, 130), which is
  printed at length in Wright's Political Poems and Songs (Record Series),
  vol. ii. pp. 39-114; together with a rejoinder by Jack Upland, printed on
  the same pages. The friar's reply is often cited in the Notes below,
  where the number refers to the page of the above-named volume. See
  further in the Introduction.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Jack Uplande</i>, Jack the Countryman, a nickname for one who is
  supposed to have had but little education; cf. the <i>Plowman's</i>
  Tale.</p>

  <p>6. <i>fellest folk</i>, the wickedest people; referring to the
  friars.</p>

  <p>7. The friar's reply copies several of these expressions: thus we
  find&mdash;'<i>On wounder wise</i>, seith Jak, freres, ye ben growun'; p.
  42.</p>

  <p>8. '<i>sowen</i> in youre sectes of <i>Anticristis</i> hondes'; p.
  42.</p>

  <p>9. <i>not obedient</i>; 'unboxom <i>to bishopis</i>, not <i>lege men
  to kynges</i>'; p. 42. The friar asserts that they <i>do</i> obey the
  bishops; but carefully adds&mdash;'although not so fer forth as seculer
  preestes'; p. 44. <!-- Page 493 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page493"></a>[493]</span></p>

  <p>11. '<i>wede, corn, ne gras</i>, wil ye not hewen'; p. 42; repeated on
  p. 44. The friar retorts that they are not expected to cleanse ditches,
  like a Jack Upland; p. 44. We thus learn that <i>woode</i> in l. 11 is
  almost certainly an error for <i>weede</i>.</p>

  <p>15. <i>where to been</i>, where they will (hereafter) go to.</p>

  <p>21. See 1 Cor. xiii. 1-3.</p>

  <p>27. <i>skilfully</i>, reasonably; <i>skill</i> often has the sense of
  reason.</p>

  <p>28. The friar evades the question as to the number of orders, and
  replies that he is of Christ's order; pp. 59-61.</p>

  <p>35. Reply: St. James makes mention of two kinds of life, the active
  and the contemplative; we belong to the latter; pp. 63-6.</p>

  <p>37. <i>apostata</i>, apostate; a term applied to a friar who left his
  order (see l. 42) <i>after</i> his year of probation had been completed,
  or else (see l. 42) after a probation of three months. See ll. 273-5, and
  310-2 below; and the note to P. Plowman, C. ii. 98 (B. i. 104). The
  question here put was not answered.</p>

  <p>40-1. Reply: it is shocking to speak of men leaving their wives like
  this; we are not wedded to our habit any more than a priest is to his
  tonsure; p. 67.</p>

  <p>44. Reply: no. We are only punished for leaving off our habits because
  it implies forsaking of our rule. Our habits are not sendal, nor satin
  nor golden; pp. 67-8.</p>

  <p>50. Reply: what, Jack, does your tippet mean? My wide cope signifies
  charity. My hood, patience in adversity. The scapulary denotes obedience
  to our superiors. As for the knotted girdle, ask the Franciscans; pp.
  68-71.</p>

  <p>52. Reply: Why do most of the Lollards wear gray clothes? p. 71.</p>

  <p>58. No reply to this question.</p>

  <p>60. Reply: see Eccles. iii. 7; Prov. xxv. 28; p. 71.</p>

  <p>62. Reply: a question rather for monks than friars. Why do you not put
  your dining-table in your cow-house? p. 72.</p>

  <p>65. Reply: perhaps some of us go to Rome for dispensations, but most
  of us have need to stay at home, to keep watch over Lollards; p. 73.</p>

  <p>70. Reply: you have forgotten the text, 2 Cor. vi. 9; p. 74.</p>

  <p>74. Reply: Christ, at His transfiguration, had only three witnesses
  from among His apostles. And He chose only twelve apostles, out of His
  many followers; and see Prov. xii. 15; p. 75.</p>

  <p>77. Reply: a man is better than a beast; yet even for your beasts you
  make cattle-sheds and stables. Our houses are often poor ones. Did you
  ever see any that resembled the Tower, or Windsor Castle, or Woodstock?
  Your lies are shameless; pp. 77-8. I note here Jack Upland's rejoinder;
  he says that he does not object to the friars having houses, but he
  objects to the needless grandeur of them; for it does not follow that a
  man who drinks a quart of wine must therefore proceed to drink a gallon;
  p. 76.</p>

  <p>83. Reply: you say that we let the whole realm to farm. Why, it <!--
  Page 494 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page494"></a>[494]</span>is
  not ours at all! It belongs to the king. We have no more estate in the
  country than you have in heaven; pp. 78-9. The incompleteness of this
  reply is amazing.</p>

  <p>86. The original reading must have been different here. The friar puts
  the question thus: Why do you pay no tribute to the king, whereas Christ
  paid tribute to the emperor? Reply: Christ did not pay it as a debt, but
  only to perform the law in meekness. The Jewish priests did not pay taxes
  like the commons. Priests may pay if they are willing, but not friars;
  pp. 79, 80.</p>

  <p>90. Reply: we are glad to have the prayers of the poor, if their
  letters of fraternity are genuine; but we do not desire <i>your</i>
  paternosters; p. 80.</p>

  <p>92. Reply: we do not make men more perfect than their baptism makes
  them; p. 81.</p>

  <p>95. Reply: the golden trental, 'that now is purchasid of preestis out
  of freris hondis,' delivers no soul, except as it is deserved; p. 81. See
  note to Ch. C. T., D 1717 (vol. v. p. 331).</p>

  <p>100. Reply: you are quite mistaken. Perhaps some Carmelite told you
  this, or some Franciscan. The Austin friars and the Dominicans do not say
  so; p. 82.</p>

  <p>105. Reply: if you accuse us of stealing children, Christ practically
  did the same, by enticing disciples to follow him. See Matt. xix. 21;
  Luke, xiv. 33; John, xv. 19. To win souls is no robbery; pp. 83-4.</p>

  <p>109. <i>undernime</i>, reprove. Reply: according to you, not even the
  king should maintain any discipline. The pope has a prison; and so has
  the bishop of Canterbury, and the bishop of London. But you do not like
  prisons, for you often experience them; pp. 85-6.</p>

  <p>114. Reply: burial is <i>not</i> a sacrament, as you say. You
  contradict yourself; p. 86.</p>

  <p>116. Reply: if, as you say, we never shrive the poor, why are
  parish-priests so angry with us for doing so? p. 87. Cf. note to P.
  Plowman, C. xiii. 21. Questions 26, 27, and 28 are passed over.</p>

  <p>127. Reply: we do right to live of the gospel; see 1 Cor. ix. 14;
  Luke, x. 7; Rom. xv. 26.</p>

  <p>130. Reply: God knows how much good the preaching of the friars has
  wrought; p. 89. The Dominicans especially were proud of their
  preaching.</p>

  <p>133. The friar here remarks that the Wycliffites are heretics, and
  ought to be burnt; p. 90. The same remark is all the answer made to
  question 32.</p>

  <p>141. Reply: the friars do not <i>sell</i> the mass; they only freely
  give it to those who freely give to them. Even if we did sell it, surely
  the parish-priests receive money for the same; this is not simony; pp.
  93-5. See note to Ch. C. T., D 1749; vol. v. p. 333.</p>

  <p>149. Reply: we write down the names only to help our <i>own</i>
  memories; for special prayers are very profitable for souls; pp. 99, 100.
  See note to Ch. C. T., D 1741; vol. v. p. 332. <!-- Page 495 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>[495]</span></p>

  <p>153. <i>berest god in honde</i>, accusest Christ. Reply: Christ was
  lord of all spiritually; but, as a man, he was needy. David says of Him,
  'I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me'; Ps. xl. 17. I refer
  you to Matt. viii. 20; pp. 95-8.</p>

  <p>156. No special answer is given to questions 36-9.</p>

  <p>187. Reply: you expect your servant to call you 'master.' It is not
  the being called 'master,' but ambition, that Christ forbids; pp. 100-1.
  Cf. note to Ch. C. T., D 2185; vol. v. p. 340.</p>

  <p>189. The reply is singular, to the effect that pope John XXIV wrote
  against this matter, and the friars Minors (Franciscans) against him.
  'Examyne her actis, and loke who hath the beter; and knowe noon other
  ordre this perfitnesse approveth'; p. 101.</p>

  <p>208. There is no reply to question 42.</p>

  <p>211. Reply; going two and two together is a scriptural custom.
  Barnabas and Paul did so. So did Paul and Timothy. Besides, there were
  <i>two</i> tables in the law, <i>two</i> cherubim in the temple, and
  <i>two</i> in the tabernacle. It was not good for Adam to be
  <i>alone</i>; pp. 101-3. Cf. note to P. Plowman, C. xi. 8; and to
  Chaucer, C. T., C 1740.</p>

  <p>213. There seems to be no reply to questions 44-8.</p>

  <p>246. As regards question 49, the friar replies to ll. 249-51, saying
  that, according to this, no one could pray for any one; for we cannot
  tell his future destiny; p. 103. Cf. note to Ch. C. T., D 2126; vol. v.
  p. 339.</p>

  <p>258. Questions 50 and 51 do not seem to be noticed. Question 52 is
  partly answered in the reply to question 22. See l. 105.</p>

  <p>277. Reply: you admit (l. 283) that God made <i>all things</i>
  according to weight, number, and measure. But a friar is
  <i>something</i>; ergo, God made friars according to weight, &amp;c. Why
  are priests so numerous? As to a man's hand (l. 287), the number of
  fingers is fixed, and an extra finger is monstrous. But neither God nor
  holy church have fixed the number of priests or friars. 'Many hondis
  togider maken light werk'; pp. 105-6. Cf. note to P. Plowman, C. xxiii.
  270.</p>

  <p>At this point the friar introduces a subject not discussed in the copy
  of Jack Upland here printed, viz. the subject of transubstantiation. He
  says that Jack accuses the friars of saying that the bread is not
  Christ's body, but mere roundness and whiteness, and accident without
  subject; and Wyclif is adduced as saying that it remains material bread,
  and only Christ's body in a figurative sense; pp. 106-10. The rest of the
  friar's reply (which goes but little further) is inapplicable to our
  text, so that the latter part of the treatise, ll. 294-end, is left
  unanswered. Perhaps sections 54-64 were, at first, a somewhat later
  addition.</p>

  <p>296. This has been partly said before; see l. 77 above.</p>

  <p>310. It was thought that to die in a friar's habit increased a man's
  chance of salvation; see l. 100 above.</p>

  <p>320. Cf. note to P. Plowman, C. xiii. 21. See l. 246 above.</p>

  <p>336. Cf. P. Plowman, C. xxiii. 323-72. <!-- Page 496 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page496"></a>[496]</span></p>

  <p>368. This enquiry takes up a large portion of the Ploughman's Crede.
  The jealousy of one order against the other was very remarkable. See note
  to l. 100 above.</p>

  <p>399. See James, i. 27; cf. l. 36 above.</p>

  <p>411. See Matt. xi. 30. Wyclif has&mdash;'For my yok is <i>softe</i>,
  and my charge light.'</p>

  <p>421. The Franciscans claimed that St. Francis sat in heaven above the
  Seraphim, upon the throne from which Lucifer fell; see note to P.
  Plowman, C. ii. 105 (B. i. 105).</p>

  <p>424-7. Evidently intended for four alliterative lines, but the third
  is too long; read&mdash;'And whan ye han soiled that I saide,' &amp;c.
  Again, the first is too short; read&mdash;'Go, <i>frere</i>, now forth,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>430. <i>even-Christen</i>, fellow-Christian; see Gloss. to P.
  Plowman.</p>

  <p>433. 'Benefac humili, et non dederis impio: prohibe panes illi dari,
  ne in ipsis potentior te sit'; Ecclus. xii. 6.</p>

  <p>17. <i>boun</i>, ready; better than the reading <i>bounde</i>.</p>

  <p>21. I note here an unimportant variation. For <i>this is</i>, the MS.
  has <i>is this</i>.</p>

  <p>27. I find that there is no need to insert <i>the</i>. Read
  <i>requeste</i>, in three syllables, as it really had a final <i>e</i>,
  being a feminine substantive. Cf. 'Et lor <i>requestë</i> refaison'; Rom.
  Rose, 4767. <i>Requeste</i> is trisyllabic in Troil. iv. 57; L. Good Wom.
  448.</p>

  <p>36. According to the romance of Alexander, the god Serapis, appearing
  in a dream, told him that his great deeds would be remembered for ever.
  Before this, Alexander had told his men that he hoped to conquer all the
  earth&mdash;'with the graunt of my god.' See Wars of Alexander, ed.
  Skeat, ll. 990, 1095.</p>

  <p>57. This obviously refers to Bolingbroke's invasion, when he came, as
  he said, to claim his inheritance; cf. l. 65.</p>

  <p>81. <i>Of pestilence</i>, out of pestilence, to free him from
  pestilence.</p>

  <p>86. <i>lyf</i>, person, man; lit. 'living soul.' Common in P.
  Plowman.</p>

  <p>174, 179. Matt. v. 9; John, xiv. 27.</p>

  <p>185. <i>out of herre</i>, out of (off) the hinge; like mod. E. 'out of
  joint.' A favourite phrase of Gower's; see his Conf. Amant. ii. 139; iii.
  43, 52, 203, 211.</p>

  <p>197. Knights were expected to defend the faith; see note to P.
  Plowman, C. ix. 26. Cf. ll. 243-5.</p>

  <p>202. I supply <i>alday</i> (i.e. continually) to complete the line.
  <!-- Page 497 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page497"></a>[497]</span></p>

  <p>204. <i>wayted</i>, watched, carefully guarded; in contrast to l.
  207.</p>

  <p>211. For <i>any</i> perhaps read <i>a</i>; the line runs badly.</p>

  <p>218. 'It is easier to keep a thing than acquire it.'</p>

  <p>236. <i>assysed</i>, appointed; as in Conf. Amant. i. 181; iii.
  228.</p>

  <p>251. 'Let men be armed to fight against the Saracens.'</p>

  <p>253. Three points; stated in ll. 254, 261-2, and 268; i.e. the church
  is divided; Christian nations are at variance; and the heathen threaten
  us.</p>

  <p>281-3. These are the nine worthies; of whom three were heathen (281),
  three Jewish (282), and three Christian (283); as noted in Reliquiæ
  Antiquæ, i. 287. Sometimes they varied; thus Shakespeare introduces
  Hercules and Pompey among the number; L. L. L. v. 2. 538.
  <i>Machabeus</i>, Judas Maccabeus. <i>Godfray</i>, Godfrey of Bouillon.
  <i>Arthus</i>, King Arthur.</p>

  <p>294. For <i>men</i>, MS. T. has <i>pes</i> = <i>pees</i>; which
  perhaps is better.</p>

  <p>295. For <i>tennes</i>, as in Thynne, the Trentham MS. has the older
  spelling <i>tenetz</i>, which gives the etymology of 'tennis.'
  <i>Tenetz</i> is the imperative plural of the verb <i>tenir</i>, and must
  have been a cry frequently used in the <i>jeu de paume</i>; probably it
  was used to call attention, like the modern 'play!' This is the earliest
  passage in which the word occurs. 'No one can tell whether he will win or
  lose a "chace" at tennis, till the ball has run its course.' <i>Chace</i>
  is a term 'applied to the second impact on the floor (or in a gallery) of
  a ball which the opponent has failed or declined to return; the value of
  which is determined by the nearness of the spot of impact to the end
  wall. If the opponent, on both sides being changed, can "better" this
  stroke (i.e. cause his ball to rebound nearer the wall) he wins and
  scores it; if not, it is scored by the first player; until it is so
  decided, the "chace" is a stroke in abeyance'; New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>306. <i>be gete</i>, begotten, be obtained; <i>begete</i> gives no
  sense.</p>

  <p>323. <i>lyf</i>, life; not as in l. 86. See 1 Cor. xiii. 1.</p>

  <p>330. <i>Cassodore</i>, Cassiodorus. Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus, born
  about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 468, was a statesman and author; his
  chief work being his <i>Variarum Epistolarum Libri XII</i>, which is six
  times quoted in Chaucer's Tale of Melibeus. Gower, in his Conf. Amantis,
  iii. 191, quotes this very passage again; thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Cassiodore in his aprise telleth,</p>
      <p>The regne is sauf, where pitè dwelleth.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I find: 'Pietas est quae regit et celos'; Cass. <i>Var.</i> xi.
  40.</p>

  <p>332. <i>assysed</i>, fixed, set; cf. l. 236. Unless it means assessed,
  rated; a sense which is also found in Gower, viz. in his Conf. Amant. i.
  5; see the New E. Dict. The passage is a little obscure.</p>

  <p>336. 'On account of which mercy should turn aside.'</p>

  <p>339. <i>Constantyn</i>, Constantine the Great, Roman emperor from
  <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 306 to 337. Eusebius wrote a life of him in
  four books, which is rather a panegyric than a biography. The story here
  told is hardly consistent <!-- Page 498 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page498"></a>[498]</span>with the facts, as Constantine caused the
  death of his own son Crispus and of young Licinius; as to which Gibbon
  (c. xviii) remarks that 'the courtly bishop, who has celebrated in an
  elaborate work the virtues and pieties of his hero, observes a prudent
  silence on the subject of these tragic events.' In his Conf. Amantis,
  iii. 192, Gower again says:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Thus saide whylom Constantyn:&mdash;</p>
      <p>What emperour that is enclyn</p>
      <p>To pitè for to be servaunt,</p>
      <p>Of al the worldes remenaunt</p>
      <p>He is worthy to ben a lord.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But the particular story about the 'yonge children' to which Gower
  here alludes is given at length in the Conf. Amantis, bk. ii. vol. i. pp.
  266-77. Very briefly, it comes to this. Constantine, while still a
  heathen, was afflicted with leprosy. The physicians said he could only be
  healed by bathing in the blood of young children. On due reflection, he
  preferred to retain his leprosy; whereupon, he was directed in a vision
  to apply to pope Silvester, who converted him and baptised him; and he
  was cured of his leprosy when immersed in the baptismal font. The whole
  city followed the emperor's example, and was converted to Christianity.
  This explains ll. 354-5:&mdash;'so that the dear ones, (converted) from
  being the hateful ones who had formerly been at enmity with Christ,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>363. For <i>debated</i>, MS. T. has <i>deleated</i>, for
  <i>delated</i>, i.e. deferred; see <i>Dilate</i> in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>380. 'these other Christian princes'; viz. in particular, Charles VI,
  king of France, and Robert III, king of Scotland.</p>

  <p>393. These interesting lines tell us that blindness befell the poet in
  the first year of Henry IV (Sept. 30, 1399&mdash;Sept. 29, 1400); and we
  gather that the present poem was meant to be his last. As a matter of
  fact, he wrote a still later couplet in the following words:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Henrici regis annus fuit ille secundus</p>
      <p>Scribere dum cesso, sum quia cecus ego.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These lines occur in MSS. of his Vox Clamantis; see Morley, Eng.
  Writers, iv. 157. Notwithstanding his infirmity, Gower survived till the
  autumn of 1408; and was interred, as is well known, in the church of St.
  Mary Overies&mdash;now St. Saviour's&mdash;in Southwark, towards the
  rebuilding of which he had liberally contributed.</p>

  <p>It appears that negotiations for peace, both with Scotland and France,
  were being prosecuted in the latter part of 1399; see Wylie, History of
  Henry IV, i. 82, 86. It is also probable that Gower must have written the
  'Praise of Peace' before the death of Richard II in Feb. 1400, as he
  makes no allusion to that event, nor to the dangerous conspiracy against
  Henry's life in the early part of January. For these reasons, we may
  safely date the poem in the end of the year 1399. <!-- Page 499 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page499"></a>[499]</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece5">V. THOMAS HOCCLEVE: THE LETTER OF CUPID.</a></p>

  <p>This poem is imitated, rather than translated, from the French poem
  entitled L'Epistre au Dieu d'Amours, written by Christine de Pisan in
  May, 1399; printed in &OElig;uvres Poétiques de Christine de Pisan,
  publiées par Maurice Roy, ii. 1-27; Société des Anciens Textes Français,
  1891. Hoccleve even rearranges some of the material; and Dr. Furnivall
  has printed all the lines of the original of which the English poet has
  made use, in the Notes to his edition of Hoccleve's Works, published for
  the Early English Text Society, in 1892. It thus appears that the lines
  of Christine's poem are to be taken in the following order: 1-116,
  537-54, 126-30, 531-4, 131-96, 721-5, 259-520, 321-5, 271-4, 387-460,
  643-77, 608-23, 559-75, 759-800. The following stanzas, on the other
  hand, are wholly Hoccleve's own: 71-7, 92-8, 127-33, 141-7, 162-8,
  176-89, 267-73, 316-29, 379-434. The last set extends to 56 lines.</p>

  <p>Cupid, god of Love, is supposed to write a letter to all lovers, who
  are his subjects, reproving men for their slander and ill-treatment of
  women, and defending women against all that is alleged against them. In
  fact, it is a reply, by Christine de Pisan, to the numerous severe things
  that Jean de Meun had said about women in the famous Roman de la Rose. He
  is expressly mentioned by name in l. 281.</p>

  <p>I here quote, as a specimen, the first 7 lines of the original,
  answering to Hoccleve's first stanza&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Cupido, roy par la grace de lui,</p>
      <p>Dieu des amans, sans aide de nullui,</p>
      <p>Regnant en l'air du ciel tres reluisant,</p>
      <p>Filz de Venus la deesse poissant,</p>
      <p>Sire d'amours et de tous ses obgiez,</p>
      <p>A tous vos vrais loiaulx servans subgiez,</p>
      <p>Salut, Amour, Familiarite!'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>5. 'Son of the goddess Cithera,' i.e. Venus. Cithera is an alternative
  spelling of Citherea, occurring in the Cambridge and Petworth MSS. of the
  Cant. Tales, A 2215. For the construction, see note to Ch. C. T., F
  209.</p>

  <p>16. <i>Albion</i>. Of course Hoccleve has adapted the poem for English
  readers. The original has:&mdash;'Sur tous païs se complaignent de
  <i>France</i>.'</p>

  <p>28. I read <i>mot</i> for the sake of the grammar and scansion; the
  MSS. have <i>most</i>, bad spelling for <i>most-e</i>, the past tense.
  But <i>moot</i> occurs, correctly, as the emphatic form of <i>mot</i>, in
  l. 35. Cf. l. 410.</p>

  <p>30. <i>As doth</i>, pray, do; a common idiom; see note to C. T., E
  7.</p>

  <p>37. <i>man</i>, i.e. 'human being'; used generally, and including
  women.</p>

  <p>38. 'When no word can proceed out of his mouth but such as may
  reasonably please any one, it apparently comes from the heart.' <!-- Page
  500 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page500"></a>[500]</span></p>

  <p>50. 'Has the pot by the handle'; i.e. holds it securely.</p>

  <p>54. Note the accentuation: 'Aný womán.' This accentuation of words on
  the latter syllable in rather unlikely cases, is a marked peculiarity of
  Hoccleve's verse. Cf. <i>womán</i> in l. 79, <i>journéy</i> in l. 106;
  <i>axíng</i> in l. 122, <i>purpós</i> in l. 130. Cf. <i>wommán</i> in l.
  170 with <i>wómman</i> in l. 174.</p>

  <p>71. <i>To here?</i> to her? Dr. Furnivall notes that Hoccleve
  frequently makes <i>here</i> dissyllabic, when it represents the personal
  pronoun. Cf. l. 70; and see his Preface, p. xli. The reading 'To hir name
  yet was yt no reprefe,' given in Dr. Furnivall's edition from one MS.
  only, affords no sense, and will not scan, as <i>name</i> is properly
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>90. <i>souneth in-to</i>, tends to; cf. note to C. T., B 3157.</p>

  <p>95. 'They procure such assistants as have a double face.' The
  accentuation of <i>prócuren</i> on the <i>o</i> was at this time common;
  we even find the form <i>proker</i> (see Stratmann).</p>

  <p>120-2. <i>wolde ... Men wiste</i>, would like men to know.</p>

  <p>131. 'Unless he be so far advanced in madness as to spoil all with
  open coarseness; for <i>that</i>, as I suppose, women do not like.'</p>

  <p>145. 'Reason follows it so slowly and leisurely.'</p>

  <p>184. <i>dishonest</i>, unworthy of honour, blameworthy. Ray gives the
  proverb&mdash;'it's an ill bird that bewrays its own nest'; and compares
  the Greek&mdash;<span title="ton oikoi thêsauron diaballein" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F78;&nu; &omicron;&#x1F34;&kappa;&omicron;&iota;

  &delta;&iota;&alpha;&beta;&#x1F71;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;<!--
  -->&iota;&nu;</span>.</p>

  <p>192. <i>lakken</i>, blame, find fault with; as in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>196. <i>bilowen</i>, lied against; pp. of <i>bil&#x113;o&#x21D;en</i>,
  A.S. <i>bil&#x113;ogan</i>.</p>

  <p>204. Alluding to Ovid's <i>Remedium Amoris</i>. Cf. Ch. C. T., D
  688-710.</p>

  <p>215. 'They say, it is profitable to consider peril.'</p>

  <p>225. Rather close to the original French:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Et aucuns sont qui iadis en mes las</p>
      <p>Furent tenus, mais il sont d'amer las,</p>
      <p>Ou par vieillece ou deffaulte de cuer,</p>

      <p>Comme mauvais serviteurs et rebelles.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>257. <i>hente</i>, caught; <i>in hir daunger</i>, under their control,
  within their power.</p>

  <p>258. It was thought that one poison would expel another; see P.
  Plowman, C. xxi. 156-8, and the notes.</p>

  <p>272. 'It cannot long abide upon one object.'</p>

  <p>281. Jean de Meun, author of the latter and more satirical part of the
  famous Roman de la Rose; see vol. i.</p>

  <p>298. 'They are not so void of constancy.' Read <i>cónstauncè</i>.</p>

  <p>302. See Ch. Legend of Good Women, 1580.</p>

  <p>305. <i>wold</i>, desired; pp. of <i>willen</i>; see note to C. T., B
  2615.</p>

  <p>309. See Ch. Legend of Good Women, 924. <!-- Page 501 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page501"></a>[501]</span></p>

  <p>316-29. These two stanzas are wholly original. Hoccleve, remembering
  that the examples of Medea and Dido both occur in Chaucer's Legend of
  Good Women, here takes occasion to make an express reference to that
  work, which he here calls 'my Legende of Martres.' <i>My</i> refers to
  Cupid; <i>Legend</i>, to Chaucer's title; and <i>Martres</i>, to the
  Latin titles to some of the Legends. Thus the Legend of Hypsipyle and
  Medea is entitled&mdash;'Incipit Legenda Ysiphile et Medee,
  <i>Martirum</i>.' Instead of <i>Martres</i>, Thynne has the ridiculous
  reading <i>Natures</i>, which the editions carefully retain.</p>

  <p>357. 'And, had it not been for the devil,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>360. <i>her</i>, the serpent. There was a legend that the serpent had
  the face of a beautiful virgin. See Ch. C. T., B 360, and note; P.
  Plowman, B. xviii. 335, and note.</p>

  <p>379-434. These eight stanzas are all Hoccleve's own.</p>

  <p>393. <i>happy to</i>, fortunate for; because it brought about Christ's
  incarnation. The allusion is to the oft-quoted sentence&mdash;'O <i>felix
  culpa</i>, O necessarium peccatum Ade,' from the Sarum missal. See note
  to P. Plowman, C. viii. 126. Cf. l. 396.</p>

  <p>421. The day of St. Margaret, Virgin and Martyr, was July 20, in the
  Latin Church. See the edition of Seinte Marherete, by O. Cockayne, E. E.
  T. S., 1866.</p>

  <p>428. <i>I</i>, i.e. Cupid. This stanza is spoken by Cupid, in his own
  character; cf. l. 431. In l. 464, he assumes the royal style of
  <i>we</i>. It is, moreover, obvious that this stanza would hardly have
  been approved of by Christine.</p>

  <p>473-6. Imitated from the closing lines of Christine's poem:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Donné en l'air, en nostre grant palais,</p>
      <p>Le jour de May la solempnée feste</p>
      <p>Ou les amans nous font mainte requeste,</p>
      <p>L'An de grace Mil trois cens quate vins</p>
      <p>Et dix et neuf, present dieux et divins,' &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It thus appears that 'the lusty month of May,' in l. 472, is merely
  copied from the French; but, to the fortunate circumstance that Christine
  gives the exact date of her poem as 1399, we owe the fact that Hoccleve
  likewise gives the exact date of his poem as being 1402.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece6">VI. THOMAS HOCCLEVE: TO THE KING; AND TO THE KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER.</a></p>

  <p>These two Balades, each of 32 lines, are written in a highly
  artificial metre; for, in each case, the four stanzas of which each
  consists shew the same rimes throughout. The riming syllables in Balade 1
  are <i><span class="nw">-esse</span></i>, <i><span
  class="nw">-our</span></i>, and <i><span class="nw">-alle</span></i>; and
  in Balade 2, are <i><span class="nw">-ame</span></i>, <i><span
  class="nw">-aunce</span></i>, and <i><span class="nw">-ee</span></i>. A
  similar example of metrical arrangement occurs in Chaucer's Balade to
  Rosemounde. <!-- Page 502 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page502"></a>[502]</span></p>

  <p>2. <i>king</i>, Henry V, as we see from the French title.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Justinian</i>; emperor of Constantinople, <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 527-65, whose fame rests upon the justly
  celebrated Justinian Code of laws. The reference, fortunately, is
  explained by Hoccleve himself, in a longer Balade concerning Sir John
  Oldcastel, printed in <i>Anglia</i>, v. 23; and again in Hoccleve's
  Poems, ed. Furnivall, p. 8. Hoccleve is praising Justinian's orthodoxy,
  to which (as he tells us) Henry V was heir; and the exact reference is to
  the following clause in one of Justinian's laws, which is quoted in full
  in the margin of the Balade above mentioned; see <i>Anglia</i>, v. 28; or
  Poems, ed. Furnivall, p. 14. 'Nemo clericus vel militaris, vel cuiuslibet
  alterius conditionis <i>de fide Christiana</i> publice turbis coadunatis
  et audientibus tractare conetur,' &amp;c. So that Justinian's 'devout
  tenderness in the faith' was exhibited by repressing religious
  discussion; cf. l. 27. See Gibbon's Roman Empire, ch. 44.</p>

  <p>5. <i>the Garter</i>. The noble Order of the Garter was founded by
  Edward III on St. George's day, Apr. 23, 1349; cf. l. 54.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Constantyn</i>. He now proceeds to liken Henry V to Constantine
  the Great, who was a great supporter of the church; see note above, to
  Poem no. IV, l. 339. Cf. <i>Anglia</i>, v. 29; or Poems, ed. Furnivall,
  p. 15; st. 28.</p>

  <p>15. <i>do forth</i>, proceed, continue to do as you have done in the
  past. Not a common expression; see <i>forth</i> in Mätzner.</p>

  <p>18. Very characteristic of Hoccleve; the accents required by the verse
  are thrown upon the weak words <i>your</i> and <i>the</i>. But perhaps
  <i>your</i> is emphatic. Cf. <i>fullý</i> in l. 20, <i>á sharp</i>,
  21.</p>

  <p>30. Hoccleve is clearly urging the King to repress Lollardry.</p>

  <p>37. 'God would have it so; and your allegiance would also have it so.'
  This is explained in a sidenote in the margin: 'quia Rex illam
  iustissimam partem tenet.' That is, the lords ought to put down heresy,
  because their master the king was against it.</p>

  <p>41. <i>Your style</i>, your motto; the famous 'Honi soit qui mal y
  pense.' Hence <i>shame</i> here means scandal; but <i>foos to shame</i>
  is an awkward expression in this connexion.</p>

  <p>47. <i>nuisaunce</i>, annoyance; referring to heresy; cf. l. 50.</p>

  <p>52. <i>Slepë nat this</i>, be not sleepy about this; a rare
  construction.</p>

  <p>58. <i>norice of distaunce</i>, nurse of debate or strife.</p>

  <p>60. 'Variation from the faith would be a damnable thing.'</p>

  <p>64. The remark&mdash;<i>Cest tout</i>&mdash;instead of the usual word
  <i>explicit</i>, occurs at the end of several poems by Hoccleve; see his
  Poems, ed. Furnivall, pp. 8, 24, 47, 51, 57, 58, 61, 62, 64, &amp;c.</p>

  herkneth what I seye</i>'; C. T., A 855. <!-- Page 503 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page503"></a>[503]</span></p>

  <p>30. <i>to queme</i>, according to your pleasure. <i>Queme</i> is here
  a substantive; see Stratmann. Cf. <i>to pay</i> in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>49. <i>Tak'th</i> is monosyllabic, as in l. 57. So also
  <i>Think'th</i>, in l. 59.</p>

  <p>51. From James, ii. 17.</p>

  <p>56. 'To the honour of your life and the benefit of your soul.'</p>

  <p>65. The exclamation shews that Chaucer was then dead.</p>

  <p>67. The quotation is inexact; cf. ll. 120, 121 below. The reference is
  to the Wyf of Bathes Tale, D 1121:&mdash;</p>

  <p>81. Read <i>Think'th</i>; so also <i>Dryv'th</i> in l. 86;
  <i>Tak'th</i> in l. 89.</p>

  <p>100. 'Therefore God is the source of virtuous nobleness.' This depends

  <p>146. <i>kalends</i>, the beginning; as in Troil. v. 1634.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece8">VIII. JOHN LYDGATE; COMPLAINT OF THE BLACK KNIGHT.</a></p>

  <p>There are some excellent notes relative to this poem in Schick's
  edition of Lydgate's <i>Temple of Glas</i> (E. E. T. S.); I refer to them
  below as 'Schick, T. G.'</p>

  <p>4. <i>Bole</i>, Bull. The sun entered Taurus, in the fifteenth
  century, just before the middle of April. Hence the phrase <i>Amid the
  Bole</i> refers, not to the first degree of the sign, but (literally) to
  the <i>middle</i> of it. The reference must be to May 1, when the sun had
  just passed a little beyond the middle (or 15th degree) of Taurus.</p>

  <p>Even here we trace the influence of Chaucer's translation of the
  Romaunt of the Rose; for which see notes to ll. 36, 74 below. Chaucer
  reiterates the mention of <i>May</i>, R. R. 49, 51, 55, 74, 86; and ll. 1
  and 2 of the present poem answer to R. R. 53-56:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'For ther is neither busk ne hay</p>
      <p><i>In May</i>, that it nil shrouded been,</p>
      <p>And it with newe leves wreen.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>12. <i>with seint Johan</i>, with St. John for their security or
  protection; probably suggested by The Compleynt of Mars, l. 9, which
  opens in a similar strain; cf. note to C. T., F 596; vol. v. p. 385.</p>

  <p>15, 16. Compare Rom. Rose (Chaucer's version), ll. 94-5.</p>

  <p>21. <i>halt</i>, holds, constrains; the present tense.</p>

  <p>22, 23. Compare Rom. Rose (Chaucer's version), ll. 100-1.</p>

  <p>28. Lydgate is fond of calling the sun <i>Tytan</i>; Chaucer has the
  name only once; in Troil. iii. 1464. Lydgate is here thinking of the
  passage in the Knightes Tale, A 1493-6, about <i>fyry Phebus</i>. Note
  that he is fond of the word <i>persaunt</i>; see ll. 358, 591, 613; cf.
  Schick, note to T. G. 328.</p>

  <p>33. It is odd that no MS. has the form <i>splayen</i>; yet the final
  <i>n</i> is required for the metre, or, at any rate, to save an
  hiatus.</p>

  <p>36. Lydgate here copies l. 134 of the English Romaunt of the
  Rose&mdash;'The river-syde costeying'&mdash;and is a witness to the
  genuineness of Fragment A of that poem; as appears more clearly below;
  see note to l. 75. The whole passage seems founded upon the Romaunt; for
  this walk by the river brings him to a <i>park</i> (a <i>garden</i> in
  the Romaunt) enclosed by a wall that had a small gate in it. It is
  further obvious that l. 42 is borrowed from l. 122 of the Parliament of
  Foules&mdash;'Right of a park walled with grene stoon.' I may remark here
  that I have seen a wall constructed of red sandstone so entirely covered
  with a very minute kind of vegetable growth as to present to the eye a
  bright green surface.</p>

  <p>40. <i>gate smal</i>; usually called a <i>wiket</i> in similar poems;
  see Rom. Rose, 528, and Schick, note to T. G. 39.</p>

  <p>43-49. This stanza answers to Rom. Rose, ll. 105-8, 78-9. <!-- Page
  505 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page505"></a>[505]</span></p>

  <p>52. <i>celúred</i>, canopied, over-arched (New E. Dict.).</p>

  <p>53-6. Cf. Rom. Rose, 1398-1400.</p>

  <p>57. <i>attempre</i>, temperate; observe that this word occurs in the
  Rom. Rose, l. 131 (only three lines above the line quoted in the note to
  l. 36), where the F. text has <i>atrempee</i>.</p>

  <p>62. <i>take</i>, take effect, take hold, become set; an early example
  of this curious intransitive use of the verb.</p>

  <p>63. 'Ready for (men) to shake off the fruit.'</p>

  <p>64. <i>Daphne</i>. Cf. Troil. iii. 726:&mdash;'O Phebus, thenk whan
  Dane hirselven shette <i>Under the bark, and laurer wex</i> for drede.'
  And cf. C. T., A 2062; and Schick, note to T. G. 115.</p>

  <p>66. <i>myrre</i>; see Troil. iv. 1138-9.</p>

  <p>67. Cf. the mention of laurel, pine, and cedar in Rom. Rose,
  1313-4.</p>

  <p>68. The resemblance of <i>philbert</i> (Philibert's nut) to Phyllis is
  accidental, but it was then believed that the connexion was real; merely
  because Vergil has 'Phyllis amat corylos'; Ecl. vii. 63. Thus Gower has
  (Conf. Amant. ii. 30):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'And, after Phillis, <i>philiberd</i></p>
      <p>This tree was called in the yerd'&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and he gives the story of Phyllis and Demophon, saying that Phyllis
  hanged herself on a nut-tree. See the Legend of Good Women, 2557. Pliny
  alludes to 'the almond-tree whereon ladie Phyllis hanged herselfe'; Nat.
  Hist. xvi. 26 (in Holland's translation). See further in Schick, note to
  T. G. 86.</p>

  <p>71. <i>hawethorn</i>; often mentioned in poems of this period; see
  Schick, note to T. G. 505. Cf. XX. 272, p. 369; XXIV. 1433, p. 447.</p>

  <p>74, 75. The list of trees was evidently suggested by the Rom. Rose;
  see Chaucer's translation, 1379-86. Hence the next thing mentioned is a
  <i>well</i>; see the same, ll. 1409-11, 109-30. Note that the water was
  <i>cold</i>, as in R. R. 116; <i>under a hill</i>, as in R. R. 114; and
  ran over <i>gravel</i>, as in R. R. 127, 1556. And then note the same,
  1417-20:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'About the <i>brinkes</i> of thise welles,</p>
      <p>And by the stremes over-al elles</p>
      <p><i>Sprang up the gras</i>, as thikke y-set</p>
      <p><i>And softe as any veluët</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is remarkable that the French original merely has 'Poignoit l'erbe
  freschete et drue,' without any mention of <i>softe</i> or of
  <i>veluët</i>. It thus becomes clear that Lydgate is actually quoting
  <i>Chaucer's version</i>.</p>

  <p>81. The reading seems to be <i>lustily cam springing</i>; it would be
  a great improvement to transpose the words, and read <i>cam lustily
  springing</i>. Cf. 'Abouten it is gras springing'; R. R. 1563.</p>

  <p>82. Cf. 'That shadwed was with braunches grene'; R. R. 1511.</p>

  <p>87. <i>Narcisus</i>, Narcissus; introduced as a matter of course,
  because he is here mentioned in the Romaunt; see R. R. 1468&mdash;'Here
  starf the faire Narcisus.' <!-- Page 506 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page506"></a>[506]</span></p>

  <p>88. <i>Cupyde</i>; cf. R. R. 1523&mdash;'Wel couthe Love him wreke
  tho.' And see the same, 1601-29.</p>

  <p>89. Cf. R. R. 1617&mdash;'Hath sowen there of love the seed.'</p>

  <p>92. <i>pitte</i>, i.e. well of Helicon, most likely; which Chaucer
  mixed up with the Castalian spring on Parnassus; see note to Anelida, 15.
  And cf. <i>the Pegasee</i> in C. T., F 207; and 'I sleep never on the
  mount of Pernaso,' F 721.</p>

  <p>95. <i>Dyane</i>, Diana; see C. T., A 2065-6.</p>

  <p>97. <i>his houndes</i>, his <i>own</i> dogs; not <i>her</i>, as in
  several MSS. For see C. T., A 2067&mdash;'his houndes have him
  caught.'</p>

  <p>102. <i>pensifheed</i>, pensiveness; common in Lydgate; see Schick,
  note to T. G. 2.</p>

  <p>103. Cf. 'To drinke and fresshe him wel withalle'; R. R. 1513.</p>

  <p>107-12. Suggested by R. R. 1507-16; especially 1515-6.</p>

  <p>127. 'Of gras and <i>floures, inde</i> and pers'; R. R. 67. And
  compare l. 126 with R. R. 68.</p>

  <p>129. <i>hulfere</i>, holly; Icel. <i>hulfr</i>, dogwood. Spelt
  <i>hulwur</i>, <i>huluyr</i> in the Prompt. Parv. 'The holly is still
  called in Norfolk <i>hulver</i>, and in Suffolk <i>hulva</i>'; Way.
  Cotgrave has:&mdash;'<i>Houx</i>, the holly, holme, or hulver-tree.' Also
  '<i>Petit houx</i>, kneehulver, butchers broom.'</p>

  <p>131. MS. P. has <i>of colour</i>; which suggests the reading&mdash;'In
  blakke and whyte, of colour pale and wan'; but this, though a better
  line, cannot stand, as it makes the words <i>also of his hewe</i> in l.
  132 superfluous; indeed l. 132 then becomes unmeaning.</p>

  <p>136. <i>accesse</i>, feverish attack; see Schick, note to T. G.
  358.</p>

  <p>151. <i>ure</i>, destiny; O.F. <i>eur</i>, Lat. <i>augurium</i>; cf.
  F. <i>mal-heur.</i> See l. 302 below, and Barbour's Bruce, i. 312.</p>

  <p>154. <i>among</i>; so in all the copies; <i>among as</i>, whilst.</p>

  <p>161. <i>ado</i>, to do; put for <i>at do</i>; a Northern idiom.</p>

  <p>168. <i>awhaped</i>, stupefied: see Gloss. in vol. vi. <i>amat</i>,
  dismayed. Cf. Schick, note to T. G. 401.</p>

  <p>169. <i>sitting</i>, suitable; cf. R. R. 986.</p>

  <p>172. <i>grounde</i> (dissyllabic) improves the line; but <i>ground</i>
  is the correct form.</p>

  <p>176. Here the Ashmole MS. inserts 'La compleynt du Chiualier'; but
  wrongly. For see l. 218.</p>

  <p>178. <i>Niobe</i>; mentioned in Troil. i. 699. So <i>woful Myrre</i>,
  Troil. iv. 1139.</p>

  <p>227. <i>cheste</i>, receptacle; '<i>cheste</i> of every care'; Troil.
  v. 1368.</p>

  <p>229. Cf. Troil. i. 420; also Rom. Rose, 4746-50.</p>

  <p>233. <i>fro</i>, from being, after being.</p>

  <p>250. <i>Daunger</i>; see Schick, note to T. G. 156.</p>

  <p>253. Cf. 'his arwes ... fyle'; Parl. Foules, 212.</p>

  <p>260. <i>Male-Bouche</i>, Evil Tongue; cf. R. R. 7357, &amp;c.; where
  Fragment C has 'Wikkid-Tonge,' the F. original has <i>Male Bouche</i>.
  Cf. IX. 84 (p. 269). See Schick, note to T. G. 153.</p>

  <p>274-6. <i>forjuged</i> and <i>excused</i> only give an assonance, not
  a rime. <!-- Page 507 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page507"></a>[507]</span></p>

  <p>291. <i>through-girt ... wounde</i>; from C. T., A 1010.</p>

  <p>303. <i>purveyaunce</i>, providence; a reminiscence of the argument in
  Troil. iv. 961, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>304. <i>god</i>; for <i>the god</i>; but the article is unnecessary;
  see Schick, note to T. G. 132.</p>

  <p>305. 'And true men have fallen off the wheel'; i.e. the wheel of
  Fortune; cf. Troil. iv. 6.</p>

  <p>330. <i>Palamides</i>, Palamedes. There were two different heroes of
  this name. One was the son of Nauplius, king of Euboea, who lost his life
  before Troy, by the artifices of Ulysses. It is said that Ulysses,
  envious of his fame, forged a letter to him purporting to come from
  Priam, and then accused him of treachery; whereupon he was condemned to
  be stoned to death. But the reference is rather to a much later hero, the
  unsuccessful lover of La bele Isoude. He was defeated by the celebrated
  knight Sir Tristram, who made him promise to resign his pretensions to
  the lady; a promise which he did not keep. See Sir T. Malory, Morte
  Arthure, bk. viii. c. 10, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>344. <i>Hercules</i>. See the Monkes Tale, B 3285.</p>

  <p>349. <i>Gades</i>, Cadiz; where, according to Guido, Hercules set up
  some columns or pillars, to shew that he had come to the end of the
  world. There is an extraordinary confusion as to the locality and maker
  of these pillars. Lydgate here follows the account in the Alexander
  romances, viz. that Alexander set up a pillar of marble in the furthest
  end of India (l. 351); on which was inscribed&mdash;'Ego Alexander
  Philippi Macedonis post obitum Darii usque ad hunc locum expugnando
  viriliter militaui'; see Alexander and Dindimus, ed. Skeat, p. 42.
  Lydgate has confused the two accounts.</p>

  <p>354. Copied from Troil. i. 518:&mdash;'Of hem that Love list febly for
  to avaunce'; which is preceded by 'he may goon in the daunce'; see the
  next line.</p>

  <p>358. <i>Phebus</i>. Cf. 'Whan Phebus dwelled here in this erthe
  adoun'; C. T., H 1. Lydgate is not, however, referring to the story in
  the Manciples Tale, but rather to the hopeless love of Phoebus for the
  daughter of Admetus; for which see Troil. i. 659-65. Cf. Schick, note to
  T. G. 112.</p>

  <p>365. <i>Piramus</i>. See Legend of Good Women, 724; and Schick, note
  to T. G. 80.</p>

  <p>366. <i>Tristram</i>. See notes to Parl. Foules, 288, and to
  Rosamounde, 20; and to Temple of Glas, ed. Schick, l. 77.</p>

  <p>367. Achilles fell in love with Polyxena, a daughter of Priam,
  according to Guido; see note to Book of the Duch. 1070; and Schick, note
  to T. G. 94. <i>Antonius</i>, Antony; see Legend of Good Women, 588.</p>

  <p>368. See the Knightes Tale; but it is a little extraordinary that
  Lydgate should instance Palamon here.</p>

  <p>372. <i>Jason</i>; see Legend of Good Women, 1580. For <i>Theseus</i>,
  see the same, 1945; and for <i>Enee</i> (Aeneas), the same, 924. <!--
  Page 508 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page508"></a>[508]</span></p>

  <p>379. An interesting allusion, as the story of the false Arcite was of
  Chaucer's invention; see his Anelida.</p>

  <p>380. <i>Demophon</i>; already mentioned above, l. 70.</p>

  <p>386. <i>Adon</i>, Adonis; see Troil. iii. 721; C. T., A 2224.</p>

  <p>390. <i>chorl</i>, churl; Vulcan; cf. C. T., A 2222, and Compl. of
  Mars.</p>

  <p>393. <i>Ipomenes</i>, Hippomenes, the conqueror of Atalanta in the
  foot-race; and therefore <i>not</i> 'guerdonles.' He is thinking of
  Meleager, the unsuccessful lover of the <i>other</i> Atalanta, her of
  Calydon. Chaucer seems likewise to have confused these stories; see note
  to Parl. Foules, 286; and cf. C. T., A 2070-2.</p>

  <p>412. Cf. Book Duch. 1024, and my note; and Schick, note to T. G.
  169.</p>

  <p>419. The correction is obvious. The scribes read <i>iupartyng</i> as
  <i>inpartyng</i> and then made it into two words. Cf. l. 475. Chaucer has
  <i>juparten</i>, Troil. iv. 1566.</p>

  <p>458. 'So variable is thy chance'; cf. C. T., B 125, and the note.</p>

  <p>461. <i>blent</i>, blinded. Evidently the right reading, for which MS.
  S. has <i>blend</i>. This was turned into <i>blynde</i>, destroying the
  rime.</p>

  <p>462. <i>went</i>, weeneth, weens, supposes, guesses; he shoots by
  guess. Evidently the right word, for which MS. S. has <i>wend</i>. But it
  was easily misunderstood, and most MSS. have <i>by wenynge</i>, which
  preserves the sense, but destroys the rime. Cf. <i>let</i> = lets, in l.
  464.</p>

  <p>480. This line resembles l. 229 of the Temple of Glas.</p>

  <p>484. For references to similar lines, see Schick, note to T. G.
  60.</p>

  <p>488. <i>Parcas</i>, Parcae, the Fates; the form is copied from Troil.
  v. 3. Lines 486-9 are reminiscences of Troil. iii. 734 and C. T., A
  1566.</p>

  <p>491. Nature is the deputy of God; see P. F. 379, and note; C. T., C
  20.</p>

  <p>512. With the following stanzas compare Chaucer's Complaint to his
  Lady, and An Amorous Complaint.</p>

  <p>525. 'Out of your mercy and womanliness, charm my sharp wounds.'</p>

  <p>554. A stock line of Lydgate's; it occurs twice in the Temple of Glas,
  ll. 424, 879.</p>

  <p>574. Here the Knight's Complaint ends.</p>

  <p>590. 'Parfourned hath the sonne his ark diurne'; C. T., E 1795.</p>

  <p>596. Cf. 'among yon rowes rede'; Compl. Mars, 2.</p>

  <p>597. <i>deaurat</i>, gilded, of a golden colour; see <i>Deaurate</i>
  in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>612. <i>Esperus</i>, Hesperus, the evening-star, the planet Venus. See
  note to Boeth. bk. i. m. 5. 9.</p>

  <p>621. Cf. C. T., A 2383, 2389; and Temple of Glas, 126-8.</p>

  <p>627. 'Venus I mene, the <i>wel-willy</i> planete'; Troil. iii. 1257.
  Cf. <i>gude-willy</i> in Burns.</p>

  <p>644. 'For thilke love thou haddest to Adoun'; C. T., A 2224.</p>

  <p>647. MS. B. has <i>for very wery</i>, meaning 'because I was very
  weary,' which is a possible expression; see Schick, note to T. G. 632;
  but <i>verily</i> seems better, as otherwise the line is cumbersome.</p>

  <p>663. <i>Jelousye</i>; cf. Parl. Foules, 252. <!-- Page 509 --><span

  <p>4. Valentine's day is Feb. 14; cf. Parl. Foules, 309-11.</p>

  <p>8. <i>larke</i>; cf. the song of the bird in Compl. Mars, 13-21.</p>

  <p>20. <i>Cipryde</i>, really the same as Venus, but here distinguished;
  see Parl. Foules, 277.</p>

  <p>38. Apparently accented as 'Aúrorà'; Ch. has Auróra, L. G. W. 774.</p>

  <p>49. <i>crampessh at</i> must be <i>crampisshed</i>, i.e. constrained
  painfully, tortured; see note to Anelida, 171 (vol. i. p. 535).</p>

  <p>62. Imitated from Parl. Foules, 379-89.</p>

  <p>75. <i>sursanure</i>; a wound healed outwardly only; cf. note to C.
  T., F 1113.</p>

  <p>84. <i>Male-bouche</i>, Evil Tongue, Slander; from the Roman de la
  Rose. See VIII. 260 above.</p>

  <p>96. <i>Boreas</i>, only mentioned by Ch. in his Boethius, bk. i. m. 5.
  17, m. 3. 8.</p>

  <p>113. <i>somer-sonne</i>; imitated from the Book of the Duch.
  821-4.</p>

  <p>125. 'To speke of bountè or of gentilles,' &amp;c.; T. G. 287.</p>

  <p>140. 'To alle hir werkes virtu is hir gyde'; C. T., B 164.</p>

  <p>158. Alluding to the proverb&mdash;'He that hews above his head, the
  chips fall in his eye'; which is a warning to men who attack their
  betters. See I. i. 9. 20, and the note (p. 462).</p>

  <p>190-3. <i>Policene</i>, Polyxena; cf. note to VIII. 367.
  <i>Helayne</i>, Helen. <i>Dorigene</i>; see Frankleyns Tale, F 815.</p>

  <p>195. <i>Cleopatre</i>; see the first legend in the Legend of Good
  Women. <i>secree</i>, secret, able to keep secrets; a praiseworthy
  attribute; cf. Parl. of Foules, 395; and Lydgate's Temple of Glas,
  294-5:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p style="margin-left:5.2em">'and mirrour eke was she</p>
      <p>Of <i>secrenes</i>, of trouth, of faythfulnes.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is obvious that the extraordinary word <i>setrone</i> (see the
  footnote) arose from a desire on the part of the scribe to secure a rime
  for the name in the next line, which he must have imagined to be
  <i>An-ti-góne</i>, in <i>three</i> syllables, with a mute final <i>e</i>!
  This turned <i>secree</i> into <i>secrone</i>, which Thynne probably
  misread as <i>setrone</i>, since <i>c</i> and <i>t</i> are alike in many
  MSS. But there are no such words as <i>secrone</i> or <i>setrone</i>; and
  <i>secree</i> must be restored, because <i>An-ti-go-ne</i> is a word of
  four syllables. We know whence Lydgate obtained his 'white Antigone'; it
  was from Troilus, ii. 887, where we find 'fresshe Antigone the whyte.'
  Antigone was Criseyde's niece, and was so 'secree' that Pandarus
  considered her to be the most fitting person to accompany Criseyde when
  she visited Troilus (Troil. ii. 1563), and again when she came to visit
  Pandarus himself (iii. 597).</p>

  <p>197. <i>Hester</i>, Esther; see Book Duch. 987; but especially Legend
  of <!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page510"></a>[510]</span>Good Women, 250: 'Ester, lay thou thy
  <i>mekenesse</i> al adoun.' <i>Judith</i>; cf. Cant. Tales, B 939, 2289,
  3761, E 1366.</p>

  <p>198. <i>Alceste</i>, Alcestis; see L. G. W. 432, 511, 518. <i>Marcia
  Catoun</i>, Martia, daughter of Cato of Utica; see note to L. G. W. 252
  (vol. iii. p. 298).</p>

  <p>199. <i>Grisilde</i>; the Griselda of the Clerkes Tale. Again
  mentioned by Lydgate in the Temple of Glas, 75, 405, and elsewhere; see
  Schick's note to T.G. l. 75.</p>

  <p>200, 201. <i>Ariadne</i>; see L. G. W. 268, 2078, &amp;c.
  <i>Lucrece</i>, Lucretia; see the same, 1680; especially l.
  1691:&mdash;'this Lucresse, that starf <i>at Rome toun</i>.'</p>

  <p>203. <i>Penelope</i>; see note to L. G. W. 252.</p>

  <p>204. <i>Phyllis</i>, <i>Hipsiphilee</i>; both in L. G. W.; 2394,
  1368.</p>

  <p>206. <i>Canacee</i>; may be either the Canace mentioned in L. G. W.
  265, or the heroine of the Squieres Tale; probably the latter. See
  Schick, note to l. 137 of the Temple of Glas.</p>

  <p>209. <i>naught</i>, not. <i>falle</i>, stoop, droop; hence, fail.</p>

  <p>211-3. Dido slew herself; see L. G. W. 1351.</p>

  <p>214. <i>Medee</i>, Medea; see L. G. W. 1580. But Chaucer does not
  there relate how Medea committed any 'outrage.' However, he refers to her
  murder of her children in the Cant. Tales, B 72.</p>

  <p>216. 'That, while goodness and beauty are both under her dominion, she
  makes goodness have always the upper hand.' See l. 218.</p>

  <p>221. Read <i>n'offende</i>, offend not. Probably the MS. had
  <i>nofende</i>,  which Thynne turned into <i>ne fende</i>.</p>

  <p>229. It is remarkable how often Lydgate describes his hand as
  'quaking'; see Schick's note to the Temple of Glas, 947. Chaucer's hand
  quaked but once; Troil. iv. 14. Cf. note to XXII. 57 (p. 539).</p>

  <p>232. <i>suppryse</i>, undertake, endeavour to do. <i>Suppryse</i> is
  from O.F. <i>sousprendre</i>, for which Godefroy gives the occasional
  sense 'entreprendre.'</p>

  <p>234. <i>lose</i>, praise; <i>out of lose</i>, out of praise,
  discreditable.</p>

  <p>236. Perhaps this means that Chaucer's decease was a very recent
  event. Schick proposes to date this piece between 1400 and 1402.</p>

  <p>242. Chaucer invokes Clio at the beginning of Troilus, bk. ii. (l. 8);
  and Calliope at the beginning of bk. iii. (l. 45).</p>

  <p>251. Cf. Compl. Mars, 13, 14. The metre almost seems to require an
  accent on the second syllable of <i>Valentyn</i>, with suppressed final
  <i>e</i>; but a much more pleasing line, though less regular, can be made
  by distributing the pauses artificially thus: Upón . the dáy of . saint
  Válen . týne . sínge. The word <i>saint</i> is altogether unemphatic; cf.
  ll. 4, 100.</p>

  <p>257. <i>fetheres ynde</i>, blue feathers; possibly with a reference to
  blue as being the colour of constancy. Cf. <i>floures inde</i>; VIII.
  127.</p>

  <p>261. The woodbine is an emblem of constancy, as it clings to its
  support; cf. XX. 485-7. <!-- Page 511 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page511"></a>[511]</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece10">X. IN COMMENDATION OF OUR LADY.</a></p>

  <p>4, 5. In l. 4, <i>fere</i> is the Kentish form of 'fire.' In l. 5,
  Thynne again prints <i>fere</i>, but MS. A. has <i>hyre</i> (not a rime),
  and MS. Sl. has <i>were</i>, which means 'doubt,' and is the right
  word.</p>

  <p>7. For <i>her</i>, we must read <i>his</i>, as in l. 4. The reference
  is to Love or Cupid; see VIII. 354, and the note.</p>

  <p>12. Cf. 'O wind, O wind, the weder ginneth clere,' &amp;c.; Troil. ii.
  2. Observe that Chaucer invokes <i>Cleo</i> (Clio) in his next
  stanza.</p>

  <p>22. We may compare this invocation with Chaucer's ABC, and his
  introduction to the Second Nonnes Tale; but there is not much
  resemblance. Observe the free use of alliteration throughout ll.
  22-141.</p>

  <p>24. 'O pleasant ever-living one' seems to be meant; but it is very
  obscure. Notice that the excellent Sloane MS. has <i>O lusty lemand</i>
  (= <i>leming</i>), O pleasant shining one. Perhaps we should read
  <i>leming</i> for <i>living</i>; cf. l. 25.</p>

  <p>27. Cf. 'Haven of refut'; ABC, 14. <i>up to ryve</i>, to arrive at;
  see <i>rive</i> in Halliwell.</p>

  <p>28. The five joys of the Virgin are occasionally alluded to. See the
  poem on this subject in An Old Eng. Miscellany, ed. Morris, p. 87. The
  five joys were (1) at the Annunciation; (2) when she bore Christ; (3)
  when Christ rose from the dead; (4) when she saw Him ascend into heaven;
  (5) at her own Assumption into heaven.</p>

  <p>30. 'And cheering course, for one to complain to for pity.' Very
  obscure.</p>

  <p>52. <i>propyne</i>, give to drink; a usage found in the Vulgate
  version of Jer. xxv. 15: 'Sume calicem ... et <i>propinabis</i> de illo
  cunctis gentibus.'</p>

  <p>56. Cf. <i>magnificence</i> in Ch. Sec. Nonnes Tale, G 50.</p>

  <p>58. <i>put in prescripcioun</i>, i.e. prescribed, recommended.</p>

  <p>60. Cf. 'I flee for socour to thy tente'; ABC, 41.</p>

  <p>64. <i>itinerárie</i>, a description of the way.</p>

  <p>65. <i>bravie</i>, prize, especially in an athletic contest; Lat.
  <i>brauium</i>, Gk. <span title="brabeion" class="grk"
  >&beta;&rho;&alpha;&beta;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;</span>, in 1 Cor.
  ix. 24. See note to C. T., D 75.</p>

  <p>66. <i>diourn denárie</i>, daily pay, as of a penny a day; referring
  to Matt. xx. 2: 'Conventione autem facta cum operariis ex <i>denario
  diurno</i>.'</p>

  <p>68. <i>Laureat crowne</i>, crown of laurel.</p>

  <p>69. <i>palestre</i>, a wrestling-match; cf. Troil. v. 304.</p>

  <p>70. <i>lake</i>, fine white linen cloth; as in C. T., B 2048.</p>

  <p>71. <i>citole</i>, harp; as in C. T., A 1959.</p>

  <p>78. 'The wedded turtel, with her herte trewe'; Parl. Foules, 355.</p>

  <p>83. <i>Phebus</i>; here used, in an extraordinary manner, of the Holy
  Spirit, as being the spirit of wisdom; perhaps suggested by the mention
  of the <i>columbe</i> (or dove) in l. 79.</p>

  <p>87. Here Thynne prints <i>dyametre</i>, but the Sloane MS. corrects
  him.</p>

  <p>88. <i>Fewe feres</i>, few companions; i.e. few equals. <!-- Page 512
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page512"></a>[512]</span></p>

  <p>92, 93. <i>loupe</i>; cf. F. <i>loupe</i>, an excrescence, fleshy
  kernel, knot in wood, lens, knob. It was also a term in jewellery. Littré
  has: 'pierre précieuse que la nature n'a pas achevée. Loupe de saphir,
  loupe de rubis, certaines parties imparfaites et grossières qui se
  trouvent quelquefois dans ces pierres.' Hence it is not a very happy
  epithet, but Lydgate must have meant it in a good sense, as expressing
  the densest portion of a jewel; hence his 'stable (i.e. firm) as the
  loupe.' Similarly he explains <i>ewage</i> as being 'fresshest of
  visage,' i.e. clearest in appearance. <i>Ewage</i> was a term applied to
  a jacinth of the colour of sea-water; see New E. Dict. and P. Plowman, B.
  ii. 14; but it is here described as <i>blue</i>, and must therefore refer
  to a stone of the colour of water in a lake.</p>

  <p>98. Read <i>hértè</i> for the scansion; but it is a bad line. It
  runs:&mdash;And hém . recéyvest . wíth . hértè . ful tréwe.</p>

  <p>99. <i>gladded</i>, gladdened; referring to the Annunciation.</p>

  <p>102. <i>obumbred</i>, spread like a shadow; 'uirtus Altissimi
  <i>obumbrabit</i> tibi'; Luke, i. 35. This explains <i>to thee</i>, which
  answers to <i>tibi</i>.</p>

  <p>106. This stanza refers to Christ rather than to Mary; see l. 112. But
  Mary is referred to as the <i>ground</i> on which He built (l. 111).</p>

  <p>107. Cf. Isaiah, xi. 1; Jerem. xxiii. 5.</p>

  <p>110. <i>corn</i>, grain; 'suscitabo Dauid germen iustum'; Jer. xxiii.
  5. Cf. 'ex semine Dauid uenit Christus; John, vii. 42.</p>

  <p>111. <i>ground</i>; the ground upon which it pleased Him to build.
  Referring to Mary.</p>

  <p>113. <i>vytre</i>, glass; Lat. <i>uitreum</i>. The Virgin was often
  likened to glass; sun-rays pass through it, and leave it pure.</p>

  <p>114. <i>Tytan</i>, sun; curiously applied. Christ seems to be meant;
  see l. 116. But <i>thy</i> in l. 115 again refers to Mary. Hence, in l.
  114 (as in 116) we should read <i>his</i> for <i>thy</i>.</p>

  <p>118. <i>Sunamyte</i>, Shunammite; Lat. <i>Sunamitis</i>, 2 Kings, iv.
  25. She was an emblem of the Virgin, because her son was raised from the
  dead.</p>

  <p>119. <i>Mesure</i>, moderate, assuage. <i>Margaryte</i>, pearl; as an
  epithet of the Virgin.</p>

  <p>121. <i>punical pome</i>, pomegranate; Pliny has <i>Punicum malum</i>
  in this sense; Nat. Hist. xiii. 19.</p>

  <p>122. <i>bouk and boon</i>, body and bone; see <i>Bouk</i> in the New
  E. Dict.</p>

  <p>123. <i>agnelet</i>, little lamb; not in the New E. Dict., because
  this stanza is now first printed.</p>

  <p>126. <i>habounde</i>, abundant; of this adj. the New E. Dict, gives
  two examples.</p>

  <p>128. <i>Cockle</i>, shell; referring to the shell in which the pearl
  was supposed to be generated by dew. See note to I. ii. 12. 47, p.
  475.</p>

  <p>129. 'O bush unbrent'; C. T., B 1658; see the note, <i>fyrles</i>, set
  on fire without any fire (i.e. without visible cause).</p>

  <p>132. Referring to Gideon's fleece; Judges, vi. 39.</p>

  <p>133. Referring to Aaron's rod that budded; Heb. ix. 4. <!-- Page 513
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page513"></a>[513]</span></p>

  <p>134. <i>misty</i>, mystic; cf. 'mysty, <i>misticus</i>,' in Prompt.
  Parv.</p>

  <p><i>arke</i>, ark; the ark of the covenant.</p>

  <p><i>probatik</i>; certainly the right reading (as in MS. Sl.), instead
  of <i>probatyf</i> or <i>probatyfe</i>, as in A. and Thynne. The
  reference is to the O.F. phrase <i>piscine probatique</i>, which Godefroy
  explains as being a cistern of water, near Solomon's temple, in which the
  sheep were washed before being sacrificed. The phrase was borrowed
  immediately from the Vulgate version of John v. 2: 'Est autem Ierosolymis
  <i>probatica piscina</i>, quae cognominatur hebraice Bethsaida'; i.e. the
  reference is to the well-known pool of Bethesda. The Greek has: <span
  title="epi têi probatikêi kolumbêthra" class="grk">&#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F76;
  &tau;&#x1FC7; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x1FC7;
  &kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&beta;&#x1F75;&theta;&rho;&alpha;</span>.
  The etymology is obvious, from Gk. <span title="probaton" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&#x1F79;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span>, a sheep. We may
  translate the phrase by 'sheep-cleansing pool.' Cotgrave explains it very
  well; he has: '<i>piscine probatique</i>, a pond for the washing of the
  sheep that were, by the Law, to be sacrificed.'</p>

  <p>135. <i>Aurora</i>, dawn; mentioned in Ch. L. G. W. 774. Cf. 'al the
  orient <i>laugheth</i>'; C. T., A 1494. And cf. 'Th'olyve of pees'; Parl.
  Foules, 181.</p>

  <p>136. 'Column, with its base, which bears up (or supports) out of the
  abysmal depth.'</p>

  <p>137. 'Why could I not be skilful?'</p>

  <p>140. I make up this line as best I can; the readings are all bad.</p>

  <p>Note that, at this point, the MS. copies come to an end, and so does
  the alliteration. Poem no. XI is joined on to no. X in Thynne without any
  break, but is obviously a different piece, addressed to an earthly
  mistress.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece11">XI. TO MY SOVERAIN LADY.</a></p>

  <p>1. Imitated from C. T., B 778: 'I ne have noon English digne,' &amp;c.
  Cf. l. 41. And see the Introduction.</p>

  <p>8. 'For if I could sing what I feel in love, I would (gladly do
  so).'</p>

  <p>14. 'I have all my trust in thee.' The scansion is got by grouping the
  syllables thus: J'áy . en vóus . tóute . má . fiáunce. It is a line of
  the Lydgate type, in which the first syllable in the normal line, and the
  first syllable after the cæsura, are alike dropped.</p>

  <p>17. <i>thou knette</i>, mayst thou knit; the subj. or optative
  mood.</p>

  <p>21. This quotation is most interesting, being taken from the first
  line in 'Merciless Beauty'; Ch. Minor Poems; no. XI. Cf. l. 54.</p>

  <p>23. <i>it is</i>; pronounced either as <i>it's</i> or <i>'t is</i>.
  The latter sounds better.</p>

  <p>26. The substitution of <i>ginne</i> for <i>beginne</i> much improves
  the line.</p>

  <p><i>on esperaunce</i>, in hope.</p>

  <p>44. <i>in o degree</i>, (being) always in one state.</p>

  <p>49. 'Weep for me, if a lover pleases you.'</p>

  <p>56. 'So much it grieves to be away from my lady.'</p>

  <p>59. 'Now my heart has what it wished for.' <!-- Page 514 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page514"></a>[514]</span></p>

  <p>64. <i>were</i>, should be, ought to be (subjunctive).</p>

  <p>68. <i>go love</i>, go and love, learn to love. <i>wher</i>,
  whether.</p>

  <p>77. <i>and also</i>, including. The 'fair' Rosamond is mentioned in P.
  Plowman, B. xii. 48; which shews that her name was proverbial.</p>

  <p>98. 'Embrace me closely with a joyful heart.'</p>

  <p>100. 'The ardent hope that pricks my heart, is dead; the hope&mdash;to
  gain the love of her whom I desire.'</p>

  <p>103. 'And I know well that it is not my fault; (the fault of me) who
  sing for you, as I may, by way of lament at your departure.' O.F.
  <i>sai</i>, I know, is a correct form.</p>

  <p>107. <i>sad</i>, fixed, resolute, firm, constant.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece12">XII. BALLAD OF GOOD COUNSEL.</a></p>

  <p>7. Cf. Prov. xvii. 20: 'He that hath a perverse tongue falleth into
  mischief.'</p>

  <p>15. <i>equipolent</i>, equal in power; used by Hoccleve (New E.
  Dict.).</p>

  <p>16. <i>peregal</i>, the same as <i>paregal</i>, fully equal; Troil. v.
  840.</p>

  <p>22. I follow the order of stanzas in MS. H. (Harl. 2251), which is
  more complete than any other copy, as it alone contains ll. 71-7. Th. and
  Ff. transpose this stanza and the next one.</p>

  <p>23. <i>amorous</i> is evidently used as a term of disparagement, i.e.
  'wanton.'</p>

  <p>33. <i>this is</i>; pronounced as <i>this</i>, as often elsewhere.</p>

  <p>40. <i>deslavee</i>, loose, unchaste; see Gloss. to Chaucer.</p>

  <p>45. Accent <i>dévourour</i> on the first syllable.</p>

  <p>60. <i>dissolucioun</i>, dissolute behaviour.</p>

  <p>71-7. In Harl. 2251 only. In l. 71, read <i>is</i>; the MS. has
  <i>in</i>.</p>

  <p>73. The missing word is obviously <i>mene</i>, i.e. middling; missed
  because the similar word <i>men</i> happened to follow it.</p>

  <p>78. <i>prudent</i> seems here to be used in a bad sense; cf. mod. E.
  'knowing.'</p>

  <p>86. In the course of ll. 86-103, Lydgate contrives to mention all the
  Nine Worthies except Godfrey of Bouillon; i.e. he mentions David, Joshua,
  Judas Maccabaeus, Hector, Julius Caesar, Alexander, Charles
  (Charlemagne), and King Arthur. His other examples are Solomon, Troilus,
  Tullius Cicero, Seneca, and Cato; all well known.</p>

  <p>96. Thynne has&mdash;'With <i>al</i> Alisaundres.' The word <i>al</i>
  is needless, and probably due to repeating the first syllable of
  <i>Alisaundre</i>.</p>

  <p>107. We now come to examples of famous women. <i>Hestre</i> is Esther,
  and <i>Griseldes</i>, the Grisildis of Chaucer's Clerkes Tale. Others are
  Judith (in the Apocrypha), Polyxena, Penelope, Helen, Medea, Marcia the
  daughter of Marcus Cato Uticensis (see note to Legend of Good Women,
  252), and Alcestis. They are all taken from Chaucer; Esther, Polyxena,
  Penelope, Helen, 'Marcia Catoun,' are all mentioned in the 'Balade' in
  Legend of Good Women, Prologue, B-text, 249-69; <!-- Page 515 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page515"></a>[515]</span>and Alcestis is the
  heroine of the same Prologue. The Legend contains the story of Medea at
  length; and Judith is celebrated in the Monkes Tale. See the similar list
  in IX. 190-210.</p>

  <p>110. For <i>Policenes</i>, Ff. has <i>Penilops</i> (!); but Penelope
  is mentioned in l. 113. <i>Policenes</i> is right; see IX. 190.</p>

  <p>115. For <i>Eleynes</i>, the printed editions have the astonishing
  reading <i>Holynesse</i>, a strange perversion of <i>Heleynes</i>.</p>

  <p>121. <i>kerve</i>, cut; suggested by Chaucer's use of
  <i>forkerveth</i> in the Manciple's Tale, H 340. This <i>is</i> tolerably
  certain, as in l. 129 he again refers to the same Tale, H 332-4.</p>

  <p>130. Chaucer does not mention Cato; he merely says&mdash;'Thus lerne
  children whan that they ben yonge.' Both Chaucer and Lydgate had no doubt
  been taught some of the sayings of Dionysius Cato in their youth; for see
  Troil. iii. 293-4. This particular precept occurs in the third distich in

  H 332 (vol. v. p. 443).</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece13">XIII. BEWARE OF DOUBLENESS.</a></p>

  <p>This piece is gently ironical throughout, as, for example, in ll. 15,
  23, 31, 39, 47, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>30. <i>abit</i>, abideth, abides, remains, is constant.</p>

  <p>32 (footnote). The remark in the margin&mdash;'Per
  antifrasim'&mdash;simply means that the text is ironical.</p>

  <p>48. <i>tache</i>, defect; this is Shakespeare's <i>touch</i>, in the
  same sense; Troilus and Cressida, iii. 3. 175.</p>

  <p>51. <i>sliper</i>, slippery; A.S. <i>slipor</i>; as in XVI. 262. Cf.
  HF. 2154, and the note.</p>

  <p>55. 'Who can (so) guide their sail as to row their boat with craft.'
  Not clearly put. Is there a reference to Wade's boat? Cf. C. T., E 1424,
  and the note. The irony seems here to be dropped, as in ll. 71, 79.</p>

  <p>75. <i>sys and sink</i>, six and five, a winning throw at hazard; see
  C. T., B 124, and the note. <i>avaunce</i>, get profit, make gain.</p>

  <p>77, 78. Here <i>sette</i> seems to mean 'lay a stake upon,' in the
  game of hazard; when, if the player throws double aces (<i>ambes as</i>),
  he loses; see the note on C. T., B 124 as above; and see <i>Ambs-Ace</i>
  in the New E. Dict. It is amusing to find that Stowe so wholly
  misunderstood the text as to print <i>lombes, as</i> (see footnote on p.
  293); for <i>lombes</i> means 'lambs'!</p>

  <p>83. <i>innocence</i> is, I suppose, to be taken ironically; but the
  constancy of Rosamond and Cleopatra is appealed to as being real. For the
  ballad of 'Fair Rosamond,' see Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry.</p>

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 516 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page516"></a>[516]</span></p>

  <p>89, 90. <i>sengle</i>, single. <i>oo-fold</i>, one-fold, as distinct
  from <i>double</i>. See the whimsical praise of 'double' things in Hood's
  Miss Kilmansegg, in the section entitled 'Her Honeymoon.'</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece14">XIV. A BALADE: WARNING MEN, <span class="sm">ETC.</span></a></p>

  <p>6. <i>see at y</i>, see by the outward appearance; cf. C. T., G 964,
  1059. This Balade resembles no. XIII. Cf. l. 4 with XIII. 63, 81.</p>

  <p>7. <i>et</i>, eateth, eats. This contracted form evidently best suits
  the scansion. The copy in MS. T. had originally <i>ette</i>, mis-spelt
  for <i>et</i>, with <i>ettyth</i> written above it, shewing that the old
  form <i>et</i> was obsolescent. <i>Et</i> (eateth) occurs in P. Plowman,
  C. vii. 431; and again, in the same, B. xv. 175, the MSS. have
  <i>eet</i>, <i>eteth</i>, <i>ette</i>, with the same sense. 'The blind
  eat many flies' is given in Hazlitt's Collection of Proverbs. Skelton has
  it, Works, ed. Dyce, i. 213; and Hazlitt gives four more references.</p>

  <p>9. <i>geson</i>, scarce, rare, seldom found; see note to P. Plowman,
  B. xiii. 270.</p>

  <p>19. Remember to pronounce <i>this is</i> (<i>this's</i>) as
  <i>this</i>.</p>

  <p>25. A common proverb; see note to C. T., G 962.</p>

  <p>26. 'But ay fortune hath in hir hony galle'; C. T., B 3537.</p>

  <p>29. The proverbial line quoted in T. is here referred to, viz.
  'Fallere, flere, nere, tria sunt hec in muliere.' In the margin of the
  Corpus MS. of the C. T., opposite D 402, is written&mdash;'Fallere,
  flere, nere, dedit Deus in muliere.' See that passage in the Wife's
  Preamble.</p>

  <p>33. <i>sleight</i>; pronounced (<i>sleit</i>), riming with
  <i>bait</i>; shewing that the <i>gh</i> was by this time a negligible
  quantity.</p>

  <p>36. The reference is to the proverb quoted in the note to C. T., B
  2297 (vol. v. p. 208):&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hence <i>light</i> in l. 37 should be <i>leit</i>, as it means
  'lightning'; which explains 'passeth in a throw,' i.e. passes away
  instantly. We also see that Lydgate's original varied, and must have run
  thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece15">XV. THREE SAYINGS.</a></p>

  <p>(A). 2. <i>Honour</i>, i.e. advancement. The Lat. proverb
  is&mdash;'Honores mutant mores'; on which Ray remarks&mdash;'As poverty
  depresseth and debaseth a man's mind, so great place and estate advance
  and enlarge it, but many times corrupt and puff it up.' <i>outrage</i>,
  extravagant self-importance.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece16">XVI. LA BELLE DAME.</a></p>

  <p>1-28. The first four stanzas are original; so also are the four at the
  end. These stanzas have seven lines; the rest have eight.</p>

  <p>10. Read <i>called</i> as <i>call'd</i>; <i>Bell-e</i> and
  <i>Dam-e</i> are dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Aleyn</i>; i.e. Alain Chartier, a French poet and prose writer,
  born in 1386, who died in 1458. He lived at the court of Charles VI and
  Charles VII, to whom he acted as secretary. Besides La Belle Dame sans
  Merci, he wrote several poems; in one of these, called Le Livre de Quatre
  Dames, four ladies bewail the loss of their lovers in the battle of
  Agincourt. He also wrote some prose pieces, chiefly satirical; his
  <i>Curial</i>, directed against the vices of the court, was translated by
  Caxton. Caxton's translation was printed by him in 1484, and reprinted by
  the Early English Text Society in 1888. The best edition of Chartier's
  works is that by A. Duchesne (Paris, 1617); a new edition is much
  wanted.</p>

  <p>45. I here quote the original of this stanza, as it settles the right
  reading of l. 47, where some MSS. have <i>eyen</i> or <i>eyn</i> for
  <i>pen</i>.</p>

  <p>65, 66. <i>forcer</i>, casket; <i>unshet</i>, opened; <i>sperd</i>,
  fastened, locked up.</p>

  <p>103 (footnote). <i>deedly</i>, inanimate, dull, sleepy; an unusual use
  of the word. Only in Thynne, who seems to be wrong.</p>

  <p>105, 106. <i>som</i>, i.e. some male guests. <i>their juges</i>,
  (apparently) the ladies who ruled them, whom they wooed; cf. l. 137.
  <i>demure</i>, serious, grave; an early example of the word; cf. XX. 459,
  XXI. 82. <!-- Page 518 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page518"></a>[518]</span></p>

  <p>105. <i>most fresshest</i>, who had most newly arrived; 'Tels y ot qui
  à l'heure vinrent.'</p>

  <p>137. <i>scole-maister</i>, i.e. his mistress who ruled him; cf.
  <i>her</i> in l. 139.</p>

  <p>145. The right reading is <i>shot</i>, as in Thynne and MS. Ff., which
  are usually better authorities than MSS. F. and H. The original
  has:&mdash;</p>

  <p>154, 156. <i>mes</i>, dish or course of meats. <i>entremes</i>,
  ill-spelt <i>entremass</i> in Barbour's Bruce, xvi. 457; on which my note
  is: 'it is the O.F. <i>entremes</i>, now spelt <i>entremets</i>, [to mark
  its connection with F. <i>mettre</i>; but] <i>mets</i>, O.F. <i>mes</i>,
  is the Lat. <i>missum</i> [accusative of <i>missus</i>], a dish as
  <i>sent in</i> or served at table (Brachet). An <i>entremes</i> is a
  delicacy or side-dish (lit. a between-dish)'; and I added a reference to
  the present passage. It is here used ironically.</p>

  <p>166. <i>chase</i>, chose; apparently, a Northern form.</p>

  <p>174. <i>apert</i>, as in MS. Ff., is obviously right; <i>pert</i>, as
  still in use, is due to the loss of the former syllable. <i>prevy nor
  apert</i>, neither secretly nor openly, i.e. in no way; just as in Ch. C.
  T., F 531.</p>

  <p>176. <i>frounter</i>; answering here, not to O.F. <i>frontier</i>,
  forehead, but to O.F. <i>frontiere</i>, front rank of an army, line of
  battle; whence the phrase <i>faire frontiere a</i>, to make an attack
  upon (Godefroy). So here, the lady's beauty was exactly calculated to
  make an attack upon a lover's heart. Sir R. Ros has 'a frounter
  <i>for</i>'; he should rather have written 'a frounter <i>on</i>.' The
  original has:&mdash;'Pour faire au cueur d'amant <i>frontiere</i>'; also
  <i>garnison</i> in the preceding line.</p>

  <p>182. 'Car ioye triste cueur traueille.' Sir R. Ros actually takes
  <i>triste</i> with <i>ioye</i> instead of with <i>cueur</i>. There are
  several other instances in which he does not seem to have understood his
  original. See below.</p>

  <p>184. <i>trayle</i>, trellis-work, or lattice-work, intertwined with
  pliant thick-leaved branches; Godefroy has O.F. '<i>treille</i>,
  <i>traille</i>, treillis, treillage'; cf. l. 195. The original
  has:&mdash;'Si m'assis dessoubz une treille.' A note explains
  <i>dessoubz</i> as <i>derriere</i>.</p>

  <p>198. <i>neer</i>, nearer; as in l. 201. <i>sought</i>, attacked
  (him).</p>

  <p>230. 'Et se par honneur et sans blasme Ie suis vostre.' That is, if I
  am yours, with honour <i>to myself</i>. But the translator transfers the
  <i>worship</i>, i.e. the honour, to the lady.</p>

  <p>259. 'Which promised utterly to deprive me of my trust.'</p>

  <p>265. <i>Other or me</i>, me or some one else. But the French
  is:&mdash;'Se moy ou autre vous regarde,' if I or some one else look at
  you; which is quite a different thing.</p>

  <p>269-72. Obscure, and perhaps wrong; the original is:&mdash;</p>

  <p>300. 'It were less harm for one to be sad than two.'</p>

  <p>303. Read <i>sory</i>: 'D'ung <i>dolent</i> faire deux joyeulx.'</p>

  <p>324. <i>rechace</i>, chasing it back, which gives small sense; and the
  reading <i>richesse</i> is worse, and will not rime. The French has
  <i>rachatz</i> =  mod. F. <i>rachat</i>, redemption, ransom; which has
  been misunderstood.</p>

  <p>340. 'Preuue ses parolles par oeuure.'</p>

  <p>348. <i>their</i> is an error for <i>his</i> (Love's), due to the
  translator. 'Lors il [Amour] descouure sa fierté.'</p>

  </div>

  <p>357. <i>oon</i>, one; i.e. the same. MS. Ff. has <i>wone</i>, a very
  early example of the prefixed sound of <i>w</i>, as in modern English.
  See Zupitza's notes to Guy of Warwick.</p>

  <p>393. Something is wrong. The French is:&mdash;'La mesure faulx
  semblant porte'; meaning (I suppose) moderation has a false
  appearance.</p>

  <p>400. <i>As think</i>, i.e. pray think; see <i>As</i> in the Gloss. in
  vol. vi.</p>

  <p>443. 'A constrained reward, and a gift offered by way of thanks,
  cannot agree'; i.e. are quite different.</p>

  <p>449. <i>wanteth</i>, is wanting, is lacking.</p>

  <p>468. 'Qui soit donné à autre office.'</p>

  <p>469. 'D'assez grant charge se cheuit,' he gets rid of a great
  responsibility. The translator gives the contrary sense.</p>

  <p>506. 'D'en donner à qui les reffuse.'</p>

  <p>509. That <i>He</i>, not <i>Who</i>, should begin the line, is certain
  by comparison with the French:&mdash;'<i>Il</i> ne doit pas cuider
  muser.'</p>

  <p>514. <i>me mistook</i>, that I mistook myself, that I made a
  mistake.</p>

  <p>519, 520. <i>prevayl you</i>, benefit you; <i>after</i>, according
  to.</p>

  <p>523-4. <i>after-game</i>, return-match, a second game played by one
  who has lost the first. I believe l. 524 to mean 'who cannot thoroughly
  afford to double his stakes.' To <i>set</i> often means to stake. The
  French is:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Et celuy pert le ieu d'attente</p>
      <p>Qui ne scet faire son point double.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>531. <i>it ar</i>, they are. This use of <i>ar</i> with <i>it</i> is
  due to the pl. sb. <i>fantasyes</i> (i.e. vain fancies) immediately
  following; <i>other counsayl</i> is equivalent to 'as for any other
  counsel,' which implies that there are more alternatives than one.</p>

  <p>536. 'Who would like to conduct himself,' i.e. to regulate his
  conduct. 'Qui la veult conduire et ne peult.'</p>

  <p>538. Read <i>sute</i>: 'Desespoir le met de sa <i>suite</i>.'</p>

  <p>555. 'Ne de l'aprendre n'ay-ie cure.'</p>

  <p>559. 'Et le deuoir d'amours payer Qui franc cueur a, prisé et
  droit.'</p>

  <p>566. <i>That</i> is a mere conjunction; the reading <i>Which</i>
  alters the sense, and gives a false meaning. <!-- Page 520 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page520"></a>[520]</span></p>

  <p>583. <i>let</i>, makes as though he knew not; French, 'scet
  celler.'</p>

  <p>594, 595. <i>Hath set</i>; 'Mettroit en mes maulx fin et terme.' Line
  595 should begin with <i>Then</i> rather than <i>Yet</i>, as there is no
  contrast.</p>

  <p>605. 'De tous soit celuy deguerpiz.'</p>

  <p>608. <i>or anything at al</i>, &amp;c.; 'et le bien fait De sa Dame
  qui l'a reffait Et ramené de mort a vie'; i.e. and the kindness of his
  Lady, who has new made him, and brought him back from death to life. The
  English follows some different reading, and is obscurely expressed.</p>

  <p>614. 'A qui l'en puisse recourir'; to whom he could have recourse. But
  <i>recourir</i> has been read as <i>recovrir</i>, giving no good
  sense.</p>

  <p>627. The reading <i>high</i> is right; 'Que iamais <i>hault</i>
  honneur ne chiet.'</p>

  <p>634. <i>reclaymed</i>, taught to come back; a term in falconry;
  French, 'bien reclamez.' Opposed to <i>hem to withholde</i>, i.e. to keep
  themselves from coming back.</p>

  <p>635.</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>651. <i>fol</i>, foolish; F. text, 'fol plaisir.'</p>

  <p>667. <i>To have better</i>, to get a better lover. But the sense is
  wrongly given. In the French, this clause goes with what
  follows:&mdash;'D'auoir mieulx ne vous affiez,' i.e. expect to get
  nothing better.</p>

  <p>667. <i>to have better</i>, to get a better lover.</p>

  <p>668. 'Et prenez en gré le reffus.'</p>

  <p>673. The original shews that <i>she</i> really refers to <i>Pity</i>,
  denoted by <i>it</i> in l. 671, not to the Lady herself.</p>

  <p>680. 'Et iamais á bout n'en vendrez.'</p>

  <p>706. <i>By</i>; French, <i>De</i>; hence <i>By</i> should be
  <i>Of</i>. Read <i>defame of cruelty</i>, an ill name for cruelty. The
  mistake is the translator's.</p>

  <p>741. <i>Male-bouche</i>, Slander; a name probably taken from the Rom.
  de la Rose, 2847; called <i>Wikked-Tonge</i> in the English version,
  3027.</p>

  <p>750. <i>playn</i>, (all equally) flat. 'La terre n'est pas toute
  unie.'</p>

  <p>757. <i>be nought</i>, are naughty, are wicked; as in K. Lear, ii. 4.
  136.</p>

  <p>788. 'Que si tost mis en obli a.'</p>

  <p>814. <i>avantours</i>, boasters; see l. 735. F. text, 'venteus'; cf.
  '<i>Vanteux</i>, vaunting'; Cotgrave.</p>

  <p>817. <i>Refus</i>, i.e. Denial; personified. 'Reffuz a ses chasteaulx

  8-line to the 7-line stanza.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece17">XVII. THE TESTAMENT OF CRESSEID.</a></p>

  <p>This sequel to Chaucer's 'Troilus,' written by Robert Henryson of
  Dunfermline, is in the Northern dialect of the Scottish Lowlands. Thynne
  has not made any special attempt to alter the wording of this piece, but
  he frequently modifies the spelling; printing <i>so</i> instead of
  <i>sa</i> (l. 3), <i>whan</i> for <i>quhen</i> (l. 3), <i>right</i> for
  <i>richt</i> (l. 4), and so on. I follow the Edinburgh edition of 1593.
  See further in the Introduction. <!-- Page 521 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page521"></a>[521]</span></p>

  <p>1. <i>Ane</i>, a; altered by Thynne to <i>a</i>, throughout.</p>

  <p><i>dooly</i> (Th. <i>doly</i>), doleful, sad; from the sb.
  <i>dool</i>, sorrow.</p>

  <p>4-6. Here <i>fervent</i> seems to mean 'stormy' or 'severe,' as it
  obviously does not mean hot. <i>Discend</i> is used transitively; <i>can
  discend</i> means 'caused to descend.' This is an earlier example than
  that from Caxton in the New Eng. Dictionary. <i>Aries</i> clearly means
  the influence of Aries, and implies that the sun was in that sign, which
  it entered (at that date) about the 12th of March; see vol. iii. p. 188
  (footnote). <i>Lent</i> is 'spring'; and the Old Germanic method is here
  followed, which divided each of the seasons into three months. In this
  view, the spring-months were March, April, and May, called, respectively,
  foreward Lent, midward Lent, and afterward Lent; see A Student's Pastime,
  p. 190. Hence the phrase in <i>middis of the Lent</i> does not mean
  precisely in the middle of the spring, but refers to the month of April;
  indeed, the sun passed out of Aries into Taurus on the 11th of the month.
  The date indicated is, accordingly, the <i>first week in April</i>, when
  the sun was still in Aries, and showers of hail, with a stormy north
  wind, were quite seasonable.</p>

  <p>10. <i>sylit under cure</i>, covered up, (as if) under his care. The
  verb <i>to syle</i> is precisely the mod. E. <i>ceil</i>; which see in
  the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>12. <i>unto</i>, i.e. over against. The planet Venus, rising in the
  east, set her face over against the west, where the sun had set.</p>

  <p>20. <i>shill</i>, shrill. <i>Shille</i> occurs as a variant of
  <i>schrille</i> in C. T., B 4585; see <i>schil</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>32. <i>douf</i> (spelt <i>doif</i> in the old edition) is the Northern
  form of 'deaf,' answering to the Icel. <i>daufr</i>; thus a nut without a
  kernel is called in the South 'a deaf nut,' but in Scotland 'a douf nit';
  see Jamieson. For <i>deaf</i> in the senses of 'dull' and 'unproductive,'
  see the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>39. <i>cut</i>, curtail; illustrated from Lydgate in the New E.
  Dict.</p>

  <p>42. Read <i>lusty</i>, to avoid the repetition of <i>worthy</i>; cf.
  l. 41. It should have been stated, in the footnotes, that the readings
  are: E. worthy; Th. lusty.</p>

  <p>43. Referring to Troil. bk. v. In l. 92, we are told how Diomede led
  Criseyde away. Note particularly that, in l. 45, Henryson quotes Chaucer
  rather closely. Cf. 'For which wel neigh out of my wit I breyde'; Troil.
  v. 1262. And cf. ll. 47-9 with&mdash;'Betwixen hope and drede his herte
  lay'; Troil. v. 1207.</p>

  <p>48. <i>Quhill</i>, till. The reading <i>Esperus</i> in E. is comic
  enough. Even Thynne has misread <i>esperans</i>, and has turned it into
  <i>esperous</i>. There can be little doubt that <i>esperans</i> here
  means 'hope,' as it is opposed to <i>wanhope</i> in the line above. The
  word was known to Henryson, as we find, in st. 8 of his Garment of Gude
  Ladyis: 'Hir slevis suld be of <i>esperance</i>, To keip hir <i>fra
  dispair</i>.' Cf. l. 49.</p>

  <p>50. <i>behest</i>, promise; because she had promised to return to Troy
  within ten days; Troil. iv. 1595.</p>

  <p>65. <i>this narratioun</i>, i.e. the sequel of the story, which he is
  about <!-- Page 522 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page522"></a>[522]</span>to tell. He does not tell us whence he
  derived it, but intimates that it is a fiction; I suppose he invented it
  himself.</p>

  <p>74. <i>lybel of répudy</i>, Lat. 'libellum repudii,' as in Matt. xix.
  7.</p>

  <p>77. 'And, as some say, into the common court'; i.e. she became a
  courtesan.</p>

  <p>78. <i>A-per-se</i>, i.e. the first letter of the alphabet, standing
  alone. A letter that was also a word in itself, as <i>A</i>, or <i>I</i>,
  or <i>O</i>, was called 'per se,' because it could stand alone. Of these,
  the <i>A-per-se</i> was a type of excellence. One of Dunbar's Poems (ed.
  Small, i. 276) begins:&mdash;'London, thou art of townes
  <i>A-per-se</i>.'</p>

  <p>79. <i>fortunait</i>, the sport of fortune; oddly used, as it implies
  that she was 'an unfortunate.' Cf. l. 89.</p>

  <p>94. <i>but</i>, without; and Thynne actually prints <i>without</i> in
  place of it.</p>

  <p>97. <i>quhair</i>, where her father <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Chalcas'."
  >Calchas</span> (was). He was living among the Greeks; Troil. i. 80,
  87.</p>

  <p>106. In the medieval legend, Calchas was not a priest of Venus, but of
  Apollo, as Chaucer notes; see Troil. i. 66-70. So also in Lydgate, Siege
  of Troy, bk. ii. c. 17. Henryson probably altered this intentionally,
  because it enabled him to represent Criseyde as reproaching her father's
  god; see ll. 124, 134.</p>

  <p>129. <i>outwaill</i>, outcast; one who is chosen out and rejected;
  from the verb <i>wail</i>, <i> wale</i>, to choose. There seems to be no
  other example of the word, though Jamieson gives '<i>outwailins</i>,
  leavings, things of little value.'</p>

  <p>140. <i>forlane</i> can hardly mean 'left alone.' If so, it would be a
  word invented for the occasion, and improperly formed from <i>lane</i>,
  which is itself a docked form of <i>alane</i>. In all other passages
  <i>forlane</i> or <i>forlain</i> is the pp. of <i>forliggen</i>; and the
  sense of 'defiled' is quite applicable. And further, it rimes with
  <i>slane</i>, which means 'slain.'</p>

  <p>143. 'And, as it seemed, she heard, where she lay,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>147. The seven planets; which, in the order of the magnitude of their
  orbits, are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.
  And to this order the author carefully adheres throughout ll.
  151-263.</p>

  <p>155. <i>fronsit</i>, wrinkled; <i>frounse</i> is the mod. E.
  <i>flounce</i>, which formerly meant 'a pleat'; see <i>frounce</i>,
  <i>frouncen</i> in Stratmann, and the Gloss. to Chaucer. Misprinted
  <i>frosnit</i> in E.</p>

  <p>'His complexion was like lead.' Lead was Saturn's metal; see C. T., G
  828, and the note.</p>

  <p>164. That <i>gyte</i> is the correct reading, is obvious from ll. 178,
  260, where Thynne has preserved it. It is a Chaucerian word; see the
  Glossary in vol. vi. It seems to mean 'mantle.' The Edinburgh printer
  altered it to <i>gyis</i>, which is too general a term, at least in l.
  260.</p>

  <p>182. 'To ward off from us the wrath of his father (Saturn).'</p>

  <p>198. Compare Ch. C. T., F 1031&mdash;'god and governour Of every
  plaunte, herbe, tree, and flour.'</p>

  <p>205. Alluding to Phaethon's misguidance of the chariot of the sun;
  <!-- Page 523 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page523"></a>[523]</span>'And that his faders cart amis he dryve';
  Troil. v. 665. Laing prints <i>unricht</i>; but omits to say that E. has
  <i>upricht</i>.</p>

  <p>211. <i>soyr</i>, sorrel-coloured, reddish-brown; see <i>Sorrel</i> in
  my Etym. Dict.</p>

  <p>212-6. The names of the four horses are curiously corrupted from the
  names given in Ovid, Met. ii. 153, viz. Eöus, Æthon, Pyröeis, and
  Phlegon. As <i>Eous</i> means 'belonging to the dawn,' we may consider
  the words <i>into the Orient</i>, i.e. in the East, as explanatory of the
  name <i>Eoy</i>; 'called Eoy, (which signifies) in the East.' As to the
  name of the last horse, it was obviously meant to take the form
  <i>Philegoney</i>, in order to rime with <i>sey</i> (sea), and I have
  therefore restored this form. The two authorities, E. and Th., give it in
  the amazing form <i>Philologie</i> (<i>Philologee</i>), which can only
  mean 'philology'!</p>

  <p>231. <i>lauch</i> and <i>weip</i> are infinitives, but appear to be
  meant for past tenses. If so, the former should be <i>leuch</i>;
  <i>weip</i> may answer to the strong pt. t. <i>weep</i> in Chaucer (A.S.
  <i>w&#x113;op</i>).</p>

  <p>246. He seems to be thinking of Chaucer's Doctor of Phisyk; cf. Ch.
  Prol. A 425-6, 439.</p>

  <p>254. 'The last of all (in order), and swiftest in her orbit.'</p>

  <p>256. Thynne has <i>tapere</i> = to appear; this passage is curiously
  cited, in Richardson's Dictionary, in illustration of the sb.
  <i>taper</i>!</p>

  <p>261. <i>churl</i>, man; this is Chaucer's <i>cherl</i>, in Troil. i.
  1024. See the note to that line.</p>

  <p>263. <i>na nar</i>, no nearer; the moon's orbit, being the least, was
  the most remote from the outer heaven that enclosed the <i>primum
  mobile</i>.</p>

  <p>273. <i>shew</i>, shewed; but it is false grammar, for the verb to
  <i>shew</i> (or <i>show</i>) was weak. Formed by analogy with
  <i>blew</i>, <i>grew</i>, <i>knew</i>; cf. <i>rew</i>, <i>mew</i>,
  <i>sew</i>, old strong preterites of <i>row</i>, <i>mow</i>, and
  <i>sow</i>.</p>

  <p>290. As Henryson usually refrains from the addition of a syllable at
  the cæsura, we should probably read <i>injure</i>, not <i>injury</i>; see
  Troil. iii. 1018.</p>

  <p>297, 298. <i>hyest</i>, i.e. Saturn; <i>lawest</i> (lowest), i.e.
  Cynthia.</p>

  <p>299. <i>modify</i>, determine, specify; not here used in the modern
  sense.</p>

  <p>318. Heat and moisture characterised the <i>sanguine</i> temperament
  (see vol. v. p. 33); coldness and dryness characterised the melancholy
  temperament (see P. Plowman, B-text, p. xix). Cf. l. 316.</p>

  <p>343. 'With cup and clapper, like a leper.' It was usual for lepers to
  carry a cup (for their own use), and a clapper or clap-dish, which was
  used in order to give warning of their approach, and also as a receptacle
  for alms, to prevent actual contact; cf. l. 479 below. Compare the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Coppe and claper he bare ...</p>
      <p>As he a mesel [<i>leper</i>] were.'&mdash;Sir Tristrem, 3173.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page524"></a>[524]</span></p>

  <p><i>lazarous</i> is formed as an adj. in <i>-ous</i> from the sb.
  <i>lazar</i>, a leper; see l. 531.</p>

  <p>350. <i>wa</i>, woful; 'God knows if she was woful enough.'</p>

  <p>382. The accent on the second syllable of <i>hospital</i> was not
  uncommon; hence its frequent contraction to <i>spittal</i> or
  <i>spittel-house</i>; for which see l. 391 below.</p>

  <p>386. Read <i>bevar</i> or <i>bever</i> (Th. has <i>beuer</i>); the
  reading <i>bawar</i> in E. gives no sense. I see no connection with Lowl.
  Sc. <i>bevar</i>, 'one who is worn out with age,' according to Jamieson,
  who merely guesses at the sense, as being perhaps allied to
  <i>bavard</i>, which he also explains as 'worn out'; although, if from
  the F. <i>bavard</i>, it rather means talkative, babbling, or idle. I
  believe that <i>bevar hat</i> simply means 'beaver hat,' formerly used by
  women as well as by men. Even Dickens alludes to 'farmer's wives in
  beaver bonnets,' in Martin Chuzzlewit, ch. 5. No doubt a beaver hat was,
  when new, an expensive luxury, as worn by Chaucer's 'Merchant' (Prol. l.
  272); but they wore well and long, and were doubtless gladly used by
  beggars when cast off by their original owners.</p>

  <p>407. The metre, in ll. 407-69, is borrowed from Chaucer's Anelida.</p>

  <p>410. <i>blaiknit</i>, is not a derivative of M.E. <i>blak</i>, black,
  but of M.E. <i>bl&#x101;k</i>, <i>bleik</i>, bleak, pallid, cheerless. It
  is here used in the sense of 'rendered cheerless'; and <i>bair</i> means
  'bare' or 'barren.' See <i>bl&#x101;kien</i> in Stratmann.</p>

  <p>413. 'Thy bale is in the growth,' or is sprouting. See <i>Braird</i>,
  the first shoots of corn or grass, in the New E. Dict., where two more
  examples of this phrase are cited from Henryson.</p>

  <p>417. 'With goodly bed, and convenient embroidered bench-covers.'
  <i>Burelie</i> (mod. E. <i>burly</i>, prov. E. <i>bowerly</i>) answers to
  an A.S. form <i>b&#x16B;r-l&#x12B;c</i>, i.e. suitable for a lady's
  bower. This explains why it was appropriately used as an epithet for a
  bed. Cf. 'Quhair ane <i>burely</i> bed was wrocht in that wane'; Rauf
  Coilyear, 264. Hence 'a burly knight' was one suitable for a lady's
  bower, and therefore handsome, strong, well-grown, large; and by a
  degradation of meaning, huge, corpulent. The changes in sense are curious
  and instructive. In the New E. Dict., the etymology is not given. For
  <i>bene</i>, see <i>bain</i> in the New E. Dict.; and for
  <i>bankouris</i>, see <i>banker</i>.</p>

  <p>421. <i>saipheroun sals</i>, saffron sauce. <i>Saffron</i> and
  <i>salt</i> were often used together in medieval cookery; see Two
  Fifteenth-Century Cookery Books, ed. Austin (E. E. T. S.). The Glossary
  to that book gives the spellings <i>safroun</i>, <i>saferon</i>,
  <i>saferoun</i>, and <i>sapheron</i>.</p>

  <p>423. This is a very early mention of <i>lawn</i>. It is also mentioned
  in st. 10 of Lydgate's 'London Lickpeny.'</p>

  <p>429. <i>walk</i>, wake. The history of this spelling is not quite
  clear; but the <i>l</i> was, in any case, mute; another spelling is
  <i>wauk</i>. I suspect that it originated in the misunderstanding of a
  symbol. The scribe, who wished to write <i>wakk</i>, used a symbol
  resembling <i>lk</i>, where the <i>l</i> was <i>really</i> the first
  <i>k</i>, indicated by its down-stroke only. For example, <!-- Page 525
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page525"></a>[525]</span>the word
  <i>rokke</i> was (apparently) written <i>rolke</i>. See my article on
  Ghost-words; Phil. Soc. Trans. 1885, p. 369.</p>

  <p><i>tak the dew</i>, gather May-dew. The old custom of bathing the face
  with fresh dew on the 1st of May is referred to in Brand's Popular
  Antiquities. He gives an example as late as 1791. See Pepys' Diary, May
  28, 1667, May 11, 1669; where we find that <i>any</i> day in May was then
  considered suitable for this health-giving operation.</p>

  <p>433. I take <i>on every grane</i> to mean 'in every particular'; cf.
  'a <i>grain</i> of sense.' We may also note the Fr. <i>teindre en
  graine</i>, to dye in grain, to dye of a fast colour; and we occasionally
  find <i>grain</i> in the sense of 'tint.' Godefroy cites 'ung couvertoer
  d'une <i>graigne</i> vermeille'; and 'une manche vermeille, ne sçay se
  c'est <i>graine</i> ou autre taincture.' <i>Grane</i> also means 'groan,'
  and 'groin,' and 'fork of a tree'; but none of these senses suit.</p>

  <p>438. 'Take this leper-lodge in place of thy stately bower.'</p>

  <p>450. In l. 407, we have <i>sop of sorrow</i>, i.e. sop, or sup, of
  sorrow. So here <i>sowpit in syte</i>, sopped, or drenched, in sorrow; an
  expression which Jamieson illustrates from Holland's Houlate, i. 4, and
  Douglas's Vergil, prologue to Book viii, l. 5.</p>

  <p>463. This expression is imitated from Chaucer's Boethius, bk. iii. pr.
  6. 3&mdash;'O glorie, glorie, thou art nothing elles but a greet sweller
  of eres!' See note to I. ii. 8. 68 (p. 472).</p>

  <p>480. <i>leir</i> (Th. <i>lerne</i>); surely miscopied from l. 479.
  Read <i>live</i>.</p>

  <p>490. <i>lipper</i> seems to be used collectively; so also in l.
  494.</p>

  <p>492. <i>shuik coppis</i>, shook their cups; it implies that they waved
  them aloft, to attract attention. They also used their clappers.</p>

  <p>501. <i>ply</i>, plight. I know of no other example of <i>ply</i> in
  this sense; but <i>ply</i> (usually, a fold) and <i>plight</i> (incorrect
  spelling of M.E. <i>plyte</i>) are closely related; the former represents
  Lat. <i>plicitum</i>, the latter, Lat. <i>plicita</i>; from
  <i>plicare</i>, to fold (whence E. <i>ply</i>, verb, to bend).</p>

  <p>541. 'With many a sorrowful cry and cold <i>or</i> sad (cry of) O
  hone!' Here <i>cald</i> = sad; and <i>Ochane</i> is the Irish and Scotch
  cry of <i>O hone!</i> or <i>Och hone!</i> See <i>O hone</i> in the
  Century Dict., s.v. <i>O</i>.</p>

  <p>543. <i>will of wane</i>, lit. wild of weening, at a loss what to do.
  See Gloss. to Barbour's Bruce, s.v. <i>Will</i>.</p>

  <p>550. 'And climbed so high upon the fickle wheel' (of Fortune). Cf.
  Troil. iv. 6, 11.</p>

  <p>567. 'For they (women) are as constant as a weathercock in the wind.'
  Cf. '<i>unsad</i> ... and chaunging as a vane'; Ch. C. T., E 995.</p>

  <p>588. <i>wellis</i>, streams, rills; as in Book Duch. 160.</p>

  <p>589. <i>broche and belt</i>; Criseyde gave Diomede the brooch she had
  received from Troilus; see Troil. v. 1661, 1669, 1688. The <i>belt</i> is
  Henryson's addition.</p>

  <p>600. 'His heart was ready to burst.' <!-- Page 526 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page526"></a>[526]</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece18">XVIII. THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE.</a></p>

  <p>In this piece, the final <i>-e</i> is much used as forming a distinct
  syllable; indeed, more freely than in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>1, 2. Quoted from the Knightes Tale, A 1785-6.</p>

  <p>4. The word <i>of</i> is inserted in Th., Ff. and S., and seems to be
  right; but as <i>hy-e</i> should be two syllables, perhaps the words
  <i>And of</i> were rapidly pronounced, in the time of a single syllable.
  Or omit <i>And</i>.</p>

  <p>11-5. The lines of this stanza are wrongly arranged in Thynne, and in
  every printed edition except the present one; i.e. the lines 12 and 13
  are transposed. But as the rime-formula is <i>aabba</i>, it is easy to
  see that <i>suffyse</i>, <i>devyse</i>, <i>agryse</i> rime together on
  the one hand, and <i>nyce</i>, <i>vyce</i>, on the other. The
  pronunciation <i>suffice</i> is comparatively modern; in Chaucer, the
  suffix <i><span class="nw">-yse</span></i> was pronounced with a voiced
  <i>s</i>, i.e. as <i>z</i>. Note the rimes <i>devyse</i>, <i>suffyse</i>
  in the Book of the Duch. 901-2; <i>suffyse</i>, <i>wyse</i>,
  <i>devyse</i>, in the C. T., B 3648-9; &amp;c. The MSS. Ff., F., and B.
  all give the right arrangement.</p>

  <p>18. <i>whom him lyketh</i>, him whom it pleases him (to gladden or
  sadden).</p>

  <p>20, 23. <i>May</i>; cf. Troil. ii. 50-63; Rom. Rose, 51-2, 74-6, 85-6;
  Legend of Good Women, 108; C. T., A 1500-2.</p>

  <p>36. <i>of feling</i>, from experience. <i>Spek-e</i> is
  dissyllabic.</p>

  <p>39. <i>hoot</i>, hot, i.e. hopeful; <i>cold</i>, full of despair;
  <i>acces</i>, feverish attack, as in Troil. ii. 1315, 1543, 1578.</p>

  <p>41. <i>fevers whyte</i>, feverish attacks (of love) that turn men
  pale; the same as <i>blaunche fevere</i> in Troil. i. 916; see note to
  that line.</p>

  <p>48. <i>a comune tale</i>, a common saying. As a fact, one would expect
  to hear the cuckoo first. Prof. Newton, in his Dict. of Birds, says of
  the cuckoo, that it 'crosses the Mediterranean from its winter-quarters
  in Africa at the end of March or beginning of April. Its arrival is at
  once proclaimed by the peculiar ... cry of the cock.' Of the nightingale
  he says&mdash;'if the appearance of truth is to be regarded, it is
  dangerous to introduce a nightingale as singing in England before the
  15th of April or after the 15th of June.'</p>

  <p>As the change of style makes a difference of 12 days, this 15th of
  April corresponds to the 3rd of April in the time of Chaucer. It is
  remarkable that Hazlitt, in his Proverbs, p. 305, gives the
  following:&mdash;'On the third of April, comes in the cuckoo and the
  nightingale'; which may once have been correct as regards the latter.
  Hazlitt also says that, in Sussex, the 14th of April is supposed to be
  'first cuckoo-day'; whereas it would better apply to the nightingale. And
  again, another proverb says (p. 380)&mdash;'The nightingale and the
  cuckoo sing both in one month.' It is clear that, whatever the facts may
  be, our ancestors had a notion that these birds arrived nearly at the
  same time, and attached some importance, by way of augury, to the
  possibility of hearing the nightingale first. They must frequently <!--
  Page 527 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page527"></a>[527]</span>have
  been disappointed. See Milton's sonnet, as quoted in the
  Introduction.</p>

  <p>54. <i>of</i>, during; exactly as in l. 42.</p>

  <p>62. Read <i>inne</i>, the adverbial form; for the sake of the grammar
  and scansion. See <i>Inne</i> in the Gloss. in vol. vi. p. 135.
  <i>been</i> gives a false rime to <i>gren-e</i> and <i>sen-e</i>; shewing
  that <i>grene</i> and <i>sene</i> are here monosyllabic (really
  <i>green</i> and <i>seen</i>), instead of being dissyllabic, as in
  Chaucer. <i>Sene</i> is the adj., meaning visible, not the pp., which
  then took the form <i>seyn</i>.</p>

  <p>70. For <i>began</i>, which is singular, substitute the pl. form
  <i>begonne</i>. <i>to don hir houres</i>, to sing their matins, &amp;c.;
  referring to the canonical hours of church-service. Bell has the reading
  <i>to don honoures</i>, for which there is no early authority. Morris
  unluckily adopts the meaningless reading found in MSS. F. and B.</p>

  <p>71. 'They knew that service all by rote,' i.e. by heart. Bell actually
  explains <i>rote</i> as a hurdy-gurdy; as to which see <i>Rote</i> (in
  senses 2 and 3) in the Gloss. in vol. vi. p. 218.</p>

  <p>80. <i>Feverere</i> seems to have been pronounced <i>Fev'rer'</i>.
  Surely it must be right. Yet all the MSS. (except T.) actually have
  <i>Marche</i> (written <i>Mars</i> in Ff.), followed by <i>upon</i>, not
  <i>on</i>. Even Th. and T. have <i>upon</i>, not <i>on</i>; but it ruins
  the scansion, unless we adopt the reading <i>March</i>. It looks as if
  the author really <i>did</i> write <i>Marche</i>!</p>

  <p>82, 85. <i>ron</i>, <i>mon</i>, for <i>ran</i>, <i>man</i>, are
  peculiar. As such forms occur in Myrc and Audelay (both Shropshire
  authors) and in Robert of Gloucester, they are perfectly consistent with
  the supposition that they are due to Clanvowe's connection with
  Herefordshire.</p>

  <p>87. <i>swow</i>, swoon; cf. Book Duch. 215.</p>

  <p>90. As <i>brid</i> is a monosyllable (cf. ll. 212, 260, 270, 271), it
  is necessary to make <i>lew-ed-e</i> a trisyllable; as also in l. 103.
  But it becomes <i>lew'de</i> in ll. 50, 94. Chaucer has <i>lew-ëd</i>, P.
  F. 616, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>105. <i>him</i>; the cuckoo is male, but the nightingale, by way of
  contrast, is supposed to be female.</p>

  <p>118. <i>playn</i>, simple, having simple notes; cf. 'the plain-song
  cuckoo,' Mids. Nt. Dr. iii. 1. 134.</p>

  <p>119. <i>crakel</i>, 'trill or quaver in singing; used in contempt';
  New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>124. <i>I</i> seems to be strongly accented. It is a pity that there
  is no authority for inserting <i>For</i> before it. Otherwise, read <i>I
  hav-ë</i>.</p>

  <p>In Old French, <i>oci oci</i>, represented the cry of the nightingale;
  Godefroy gives examples from Raoul de Houdenc, Froissart, and Deschamps.
  Moreover, <i>oci</i> was also the imperative of the O.F. verb
  <i>ocire</i>, to kill; with which it is here intentionally confused.
  Accordingly, the nightingale retorts that <i>oci</i> means 'kill! kill!'
  with reference to the enemies of love.</p>

  <p>135. <i>grede</i>, exclaim, cry out. Not used by Chaucer, though found
  in most dialects of Middle-English. Clanvowe may have heard it in
  Herefordshire, as it occurs in Langland, Layamon, Robert of <!-- Page 528
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page528"></a>[528]</span>Gloucester,
  and in the Coventry Mysteries, and must have been known in the west. But
  it was once a very common word. From A.S. <i>gr&#x1E3;dan</i>.</p>

  <p>137. <i>to-drawe</i>, drawn asunder; cf. Havelok, 2001; Will. of
  Palerne, 1564.</p>

  <p>140. <i>yok</i>, yoke; cf. Ch. C. T., E 113, 1285.</p>

  <p>142. <i>unthryve</i>, become unsuccessful, meet with ill luck. A very
  rare word; but it also occurs in the Cursor Mundi (Fairfax MS.), l. 9450,
  where it is said of Adam that 'his wyf made him <i>to unthryve</i>.'</p>

  <p>146. The first syllable of the line is deficient. Accent <i>What</i>
  strongly. Cf. 153-8 below.</p>

  <p>151. The sentiment that love teaches all goodness, is common at this
  time; see Schick's note to Lydgate's Temple of Glas, l. 450.</p>

  <p>152. The true reading is doubtful.</p>

  <p>153-8. Here the author produces a considerable metrical effect, by
  beginning all of these lines with a strong accent. There are three such
  consecutive lines in the Wyf of Bathes Tale, D 869-71. Cf. ll. 161, 232,
  242, 252, 261, 265, 268, 270, 278.</p>

  <p>180. Bell and Morris read <i>haire</i>, without authority, and Bell
  explains it by 'he may full soon have the <i>hair</i> (!) which belongs
  to age, <i>scil.</i>, grey hair, said to be produced by anxiety.' But the
  M.E. form of 'hair' is <i>heer</i>, which will not give a true rime; and
  the word <i>heyr</i> represents the mod. E. <i>heir</i>. As the <i>h</i>
  was not sounded, it is also written <i>eir</i> (as in MS. T.) and
  <i>air</i> (as in MS. S.). The sense is&mdash;'For he who gets a little
  bliss of love may very soon find that his heir has come of age, unless he
  is always devoted to it.' This is a mild joke, signifying that he will
  soon find himself insecure, like one whose heir or successor has come of
  age, and whose inheritance is threatened. On the other hand, 'to have
  one's hair of age' is wholly without sense. Compare the next note.</p>

  <p>185. 'And then you shall be called as <i>I</i> am.' I. e. your loved
  one will forsake you, and you will be called a cuckold. This remark is
  founded on the fact that the O.F. <i>coucou</i> or <i>cocu</i> had the
  double sense of cuckoo and cuckold. See <i>cocu</i> in Littré. This
  explains l. 186.</p>

  <p>201-5. Bell, by an oversight, omits this stanza.</p>

  <p>203. This reading (from the best MS., viz. Ff.) is much the best. The
  sense is&mdash;'And whom he hits he knows not, or whom he misses';
  because he is blind.</p>

  <p>216-25. All the early printed editions crush these two stanzas into
  one, by omitting ll. 217-9, and 224-5, and altering <i>thoughte me</i>
  (l. 223) to <i>me aloon</i>. This is much inferior to the text.</p>

  <p>237. <i>leve</i>, believe; yet all the authorities but S. have the
  reading <i>loue</i>! Cf. l. 238.</p>

  <p>243. <i>dayesye</i>, daisy. Cf. Legend of Good Women, 182-7, 201-2,
  211.</p>

  <p>266. <i>Ye witen</i> is the right reading; turned into <i>ye knowe</i>
  in F. and B. The old printed editions actually read <i>The
  cuckowe</i>!</p>

  <p>267. A syllable seems lacking after <i>I</i>; such lines are common in
  <!-- Page 529 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page529"></a>[529]</span>Lydgate. The reading <i>y-chid</i> would
  render the line complete; or we may read <i>hav-ë</i>, as perhaps in l.
  124.</p>

  <p>275. An obvious allusion to Chaucer's Parlement of Foules, in which he
  gives 'the royal egle' the first place (l. 330).</p>

  <p>284. <i>The quene</i>; queen Joan of Navarre, second wife of Henry IV,
  who received the manor of Woodstock as part of her dower.</p>

  <p>285. <i>lay</i>, lea; not a common word in M.E. poetry, though
  occurring in P. Plowman. The parliament of birds required a large open
  space.</p>

  <p>289. <i>Terme</i>: during the whole term of my life; cf. C. T., G
  1479.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece19">XIX. ENVOY TO ALISON.</a></p>

  <p>1. <i>lewde book</i>, unlearned book. It is not known to what book
  this refers. It has nothing to do with the preceding poem. My guess, in
  vol. i. p. 40, that this piece might be Hoccleve's, is quite untenable.
  His pieces are all known, and the metrical form is of later date. See the
  next note.</p>

  <p>11. Too long; perhaps <i>servant</i> should be struck out. So in l. 13
  we could spare the word <i>als</i>. But ll. 17, 18, 19, 20, are all of an
  unconscionable length.</p>

  <p>22-7. I believe I was the first to detect the obvious acrostic on the
  name of Alison; see vol. i. p. 40. The sense of ll. 25-6 (which are
  forced and poor) is&mdash;'I beseech (you) of your grace, let your
  writing (in reply) alleviate the sighs which I pour out in silence.'</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece20">XX. THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.</a></p>

  <p>I give numerous references below to 'A. L.', i.e. the Assembly of
  Ladies, printed at p. 380. The two poems have much in common.</p>

  <p>1-2. Imitated from C. T., F 671; see note in vol. v. p. 386.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Bole</i>, Bull, Taurus. The sun then entered Taurus about the
  middle of April; hence the allusion to April showers in l. 4. Compare the
  opening lines of Chaucer's Prologue. But we learn, from l. 437, that it
  was already May. Hence the sun had really run half its course in Taurus.
  <i>certeinly</i>; used at the end of the line, as in A. L. 85.</p>

  <p>10. <i>very good</i>; this adverbial use of <i>very</i> is noticeable;
  cf. ll. 35, 315, 409, and A. L. 479. I believe Chaucer never uses
  <i>very</i> to qualify an adjective. It occurs, however, in Lydgate.</p>

  <p>20. Cf. '<i>more</i> at <i>hertes ese</i>'; A. L. 672.</p>

  <p>25. Cf. 'at <i>springing of the day</i>'; A. L. 218.</p>

  <p>26. Cf. 'That ye wold help me <i>on</i> with <i>myn aray</i>'; A. L.
  241.</p>

  <p>27-8. This rime of <i>passe</i> with <i>was</i> occurs again below
  (114-6); and in A. L. 436-8.</p>

  <p>30. Chaucer has <i>hew-ë</i>, <i>new-ë</i>; but here <i>hew</i>,
  <i>new</i> rime with the pt. t. <i>grew</i>. So, in A. L. 65-8,
  <i>hew</i>, <i>new</i> rime with the pt. t. <i>knew</i>. <!-- Page 530

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Cf. A. L. 47; 'into a strait passage,' and the context.</p>

  <p>47. <i>parde</i>; a petty oath (being in French), such as a female
  writer might use; so in A. L. 753.</p>

  <p>49, 50. For the <i>herber</i> and <i>benches</i>, see A. L. 48-9; also
  L. G. W. 203-4. For the phrase <i>wel y-wrought</i>, see A. L. 165.</p>

  <p>53. Bell and Morris read <i>wool</i>, which is obviously right; but
  neither of them mention the fact that <i>both</i> Speght's editions have
  <i>wel</i>; and there is no other authority! Clearly, Speght's MS. had
  <i>wol</i>, which he misread as <i>wel</i>.</p>

  <p>56. <i>eglantere</i>, eglantine, sweet-briar. Entered under
  <i>eglatere</i> in the New E. Dict., though the earlier quotations, in
  1387 and 1459, have <i>eglentere</i>. I find no authority for the form
  <i>eglatere</i> except Speght's misprint in this line, which he corrects
  in l. 80 below. Tennyson's <i>eglatere</i> (Dirge, 23) is clearly
  borrowed from this very line.</p>

  <p>58. <i>by mesure</i>; a tag which reappears in A. L. 81.</p>

  <p>59. <i>by and by</i>; another tag, for which see A. L. 87, 717.</p>

  <p>60. <i>I you ensure</i>; yet another tag; see l. 457, and A. L. 52,
  199, 495, 517.</p>

  <p>62. The final <i>e</i> in <i>peyn-e</i> is suppressed; so in A. L.
  359, 416.</p>

  <p>68. Cf. 'And as they sought hem-self thus <i>to and fro</i>'; A. L.
  43.</p>

  <p>75. Here <i>espyed</i> rimes with <i>syde</i>, <i>wyde</i>; in A. L.
  193, it rimes with <i>asyde</i> and <i>gyde</i>.</p>

  <p>89. The <i>goldfinch</i> is afterwards opposed to the
  <i>nightingale</i>. Hence he replaces the <i>cuckoo</i> in the poem of
  the Cuckoo and Nightingale. Just as the Cuckoo and Nightingale represent
  the faithless and the constant, so the goldfinch and the nightingale are
  attached, respectively, to the bright Flower and the long-lasting Leaf.
  This is explicitly said below; see ll. 439, 444. <!-- Page 531 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page531"></a>[531]</span></p>

  <p>98. <i>in this wyse</i>; appears also at the end of a line in A. L.
  589; cf. <i>in her gyse</i>, A. L. 603; <i>in ful pitous wyse</i>, A. L.
  584; <i>in no maner wyse</i>, A. L. 605.</p>

  <p>99, 100. These lines correspond to the Cuckoo and Nightingale,
  98-100.</p>

  <p>113. <i>inly greet</i>, extremely great; cf. <i>inly fair</i>, A. L.
  515.</p>

  <p>115. 'Ye wold it <i>thinke a</i> very <i>paradyse</i>'; A. L. 168.</p>

  <p>118. Better <i>I set me doun</i>, as in A. L. 77.</p>

  <p>121. 'Withouten sleep, withouten mete or drinke'; L. G. W. 177 (note
  the context).</p>

  <p>134. Here begins the description of the adherents of the Leaf,
  extending to l. 322, including the Nine Worthies, ll. 239-94. The reader
  must carefully bear in mind that the followers of the Leaf are clad in
  <i>white</i> (not in green, as we should now expect), though the nine
  Worthies are crowned with green laurel, and all the company gather under
  a huge Laurel-tree (l. 304). On the other hand the followers of the
  Flower, shortly described in ll. 323-50, are clad in <i>green</i>, though
  wearing chaplets of white and red flowers; for green was formerly an
  emblem of <i>inconstancy</i>.</p>

  <p>137. Cf. '<i>to</i> say you <i>very right</i>'; A. L. 750.</p>

  <p>144. <i>oon and oon</i>, every one of them. This phrase is rare in
  Chaucer; it seems only to occur once, in C. T., A 679; but see A. L. 368,
  543, 710.</p>

  <p>146. <i>purfil</i> occurs in A. L. 87, in the same line with <i>by and
  by</i>; and in A. L. 522-4, we find <i>colour</i>, <i>sleves</i>, and
  <i>purfyl</i> close together.</p>

  <p>148. Cf. 'With <i>grete perles</i>, ful fyne <i>and orient</i>'; A. L.
  528. For <i>diamonds</i>, see A. L. 530.</p>

  <p>150. Borrowed from Chaucer, Parl. Foules, 287: 'of whiche the name I
  wante.' Hence <i>wante</i>, i.e. lack, is the right reading. The rime is
  imperfect.</p>

  <p>155. The missing word is not <i>branches</i>, as suggested by Sir H.
  Nicolas, nor <i>floures</i>, as suggested by Morris, but <i>leves</i>; as
  the company of <i>the Leaf</i> is being described; cf. l. 259. The
  epithets <i>fresh and grene</i> are very suitable. The leaves were of
  laurel, woodbine, and <i>agnus-castus</i>.</p>

  <p>160. For <i>were</i> read <i>ware</i>; see ll. 267, 329, 335, 340; the
  sense is <i>wore</i>. Chaucer's form is <i>wered</i>, as the verb was
  originally weak; Gower and Lydgate also use the form <i>wered</i>. The
  present is perhaps one of the earliest examples of the strong form of
  this preterite.</p>

  <p><i>agnus-castus</i>; 'from Gk. <span title="agnos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&gamma;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, the name of the tree,
  confused with <span title="agnos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&gamma;&nu;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, chaste, whence the second
  word Lat. <i>castus</i>, chaste. A tree, species of Vitex (<i>V. Agnus
  Castus</i>), once believed to be a preservative of chastity, called also
  Chaste-tree and Abraham's Balm'; New E. Dict. The same Dict. quotes from
  Trevisa: 'The herbe agnus-castus is alwaye grene, and the flowre therof
  is namly callyd Agnus Castus, for wyth smelle and vse it makyth men
  chaste as a lombe.'</p>

  <p>163. For <i>But</i> Morris reads <i>And</i>, which is simpler. <!--
  Page 532 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page532"></a>[532]</span></p>

  <p>164. <i>oon</i>, one. She was the goddess Diana (see l. 472), or the
  Lady of the Leaf.</p>

  <p>171. Cf. 'That to beholde it was a greet plesaunce'; A. L. 59.</p>

  <p>172. Cf. 'though it were <i>for a king</i>'; A. L. 158.</p>

  <p>177-8. Speght has <i>Suse le foyle de vert moy</i> in l. 177, and
  <i>Seen et mon joly cuer en dormy</i> in l. 178. I see little good in
  guessing what it ought to be; so I leave it alone, merely correcting
  <i>Suse</i> and <i>foyle</i> to <i>Sus</i> and <i>foyl</i>; as the O.F.
  <i>foil</i> was masculine.</p>

  <p>Bell alters <i>de vert</i> to <i>devers</i>, and for <i>Seen</i> puts
  <i>Son</i>; and supplies <i>est</i> after <i>cuer</i>; but it all gives
  no sense when it is done. We should have to read <i>Sus le foyl devers
  moy sied, et mon joli cuer est endormi</i>; sit down upon the foliage
  before me, and my merry heart has gone to sleep. Which can hardly be
  right. The Assembly of Ladies has the same peculiarity, of presenting
  unintelligible scraps of French to the bewildered reader.</p>

  <p>180. <i>smal</i>, high, treble; chiefly valuable for explaining the
  same word in Chaucer's Balade to Rosemounde.</p>

  <p>188-9. A parallel passage occurs in A. L. 384-5.</p>

  <p>201. <i>the large wones</i>, the spacious dwellings; cf. Ch. C. T., D
  2105.</p>

  <p>202. Speght has <i>Pretir</i>, an obvious error for <i>Prester</i>.
  The authoress may easily have obtained her knowledge of Prester John from
  a MS. of Mandeville's Travels; see cap. 27 of that work. And see Yule's
  edition of Marco Polo. He was, according to Mandeville, one of the
  greatest potentates of Asia, next to the Great Khan.</p>

  <p>209. <i>cereal</i>; borrowed from Chaucer:&mdash;'A <i>coroune</i> of
  a grene <i>ook cerial</i>'; C. T., A 2290. And Chaucer took it from
  Boccaccio; see note in vol. v. p. 87.</p>

  <p>210. <i>trumpets</i>, i.e. trumpeters; as several times in
  Shakespeare. Cf. l. 213.</p>

  <p>212. <i>tartarium</i>, thin silk from Tartary. Fully explained in my
  note to P. Plowman, C. xvii. 299 (B. xv. 163), and in the Glossary to the
  same. <i>bete</i>, lit. beaten; hence, adorned with beaten gold; see note
  to C. T., A 978 (vol. v. p. 64). <i>were</i>, (all of which) were; hence
  the plural.</p>

  <p>213. Read <i>bere</i>, as in l. 223; A.S. <i>b&#x1E3;ron</i>, pt. t.
  pl.</p>

  <p>220. <i>kinges of armes</i>, kings-at-arms; who presided over colleges
  of heralds. Sir David Lyndsay was Lord Lion king-at-arms.</p>

  <p>224. Cf. '<i>Set with saphyrs</i>'; A. L. 480.</p>

  <p>233. <i>vel-u-et</i> is trisyllabic; as in The Black Knight, 80.</p>

  <p>234. 'And certainly, they had nothing to learn as to how they should
  place the armour upon them.'</p>

  <p>238. <i>in sute</i>, in their master's livery.</p>

  <p>240. The celebrated Nine Worthies; see notes to IV. 281, XII. 86.</p>

  <p>243. Cf. '<i>and furred</i> wel <i>with gray</i>'; A. L. 305.</p>

  <p>252. <i>henshmen</i>, youths mounted on horseback, who attended their
  lords. See numerous quotations for this word in A Student's Pastime, §§
  264, 272, 415-8. Each of them is called <i>a child</i>, l. 259.</p>

  <p>253. For <i>every on</i>, it is absolutely necessary to read <i>the
  first upon</i>; <!-- Page 533 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page533"></a>[533]</span>for the sense. Each of the nine worthies
  had three henchmen; of these three, the first bore his helmet, the second
  his shield, and the third his spear.</p>

  <p>257. Bell and Morris alter <i>nekke</i> to <i>bakke</i>; but wrongly.
  The shields were carried by help of a strap which passed round the
  <i>neck</i> and over the shoulders; called in Old French a <i>guige</i>.
  The convenience of this arrangement is obvious. See note to C. T., A 2504
  (vol. v. p. 88).</p>

  <p>272. In Lydgate's Temple of Glas, 508, we are told that
  hawthorn-leaves do not fade; see ll. 551-3 below.</p>

  <p>274. Read <i>hors</i>, not <i>horses</i>; <i>hors</i> is the true
  plural; see l. 293.</p>

  <p>275. Cf. '<i>trompes</i>, that ... blowen <i>blody sounes</i>'; C. T.,
  A 2511-2.</p>

  <p>286-7. 'That <i>to beholde it was a greet plesaunce</i>'; A. L. 59.
  And again&mdash;'<i>I you ensure</i>'; A. L. 52.</p>

  <p>289. I. e. the Nine Worthies; see ll. 240, 249.</p>

  <p>293. The reading <i>ninth</i> (as in Speght) is an absurd error for
  <i>nine</i>; yet no one has hitherto corrected it. How could the ninth
  man alight from <i>their horses</i>? The 'remnant' were the twenty-seven
  henchmen and the other knights.</p>

  <p>295. Cf. 'See how they come <i>togider, twain and twain</i>'; A. L.
  350.</p>

  <p>302. Cf. '<i>Ful womanly</i> she gave me,' &amp;c.; A. L. 196.</p>

  <p>305. 'Laden with leaves, with boughs of great breadth.'</p>

  <p>323. Here begins the description of the company of the Flower. They
  were clad in <i>green</i>.</p>

  <p>330. Cf. 'Her gown was <i>wel embrouded</i>'; A. L. 85.</p>

  <p>348. <i>bargaret</i>, a pastoral; a rustic song and dance; O.F.
  <i>bergerete</i>, from <i>berger</i>, a shepherd. Godefroy notes that
  they were in special vogue at Easter.</p>

  <p>350. We have here the refrain of a popular French pastoral. Warton
  suggests it may have been Froissart's; but the refrain of Froissart's
  Ballade de la Marguerite happens to be different: 'Sur toutes flours
  j'aime la margherite'; see Spec. of O. French, ed. Toynbee, p. 302. In
  fact, Warton proceeds to remark, that 'it was common in France to give
  the title of Marguerites to studied panegyrics and flowery compositions
  of every kind.' It is quite impossible to say if a special compliment is
  intended; most likely, the authoress thought of nothing of the kind. She
  again mentions <i>margarettes</i> in A. L. 57.</p>

  <p>351. <i>in-fere</i>, together; very common at the end of a line, as in
  ll. 384, 450; A. L. 407, 469, 546, 602, 719.</p>

  <p>369. <i>withouten fail</i>; this tag recurs in A. L. 567, 646, in the
  form <i>withouten any fail</i>; and, unaltered, in A. L. 188, 537.</p>

  <p>373. Those in white, the party of the Leaf.</p>

  <p>379. <i>oon</i>, one of those in green; this was queen Flora; see l.
  534.</p>

  <p>403. Bell thinks this corrupt. I think it means, that, before engaging
  with them in jousts in a friendly manner, they procured some logs of wood
  and thoroughly dried them. Hence <i>To make hir justës</i> = in order to
  joust with them afterwards.</p>

  <p>410. 'Quickly anointing the sick, wherever they went.' <!-- Page 534

  <p>417. <i>for any thing</i>, in any case, whatever might happen; cf. C.
  T., A 276, and the note (vol. v. p. 30).</p>

  <p>427. 'For nothing was lacking that ought to belong to him.'</p>

  <p>450. Here the story ends, and the telling of the moral begins.</p>

  <p>457. The meeting with a 'fair lady' was convenient, as she wanted
  information. In the Assembly of Ladies, this simple device is resorted to
  repeatedly; see ll. 79, 191, 260, 400.</p>

  <p>459. We find <i>ful demure</i> at the end of A. L. 82.</p>

  <p>462, 467. <i>My doughter</i>; this assumes that the author was a
  female; so in ll. 500, 547; and in A. L. throughout.</p>

  <p>475. Referring to l. 173; so l. 477 refers to l. 160; l. 479, to l.
  158.</p>

  <p>493. <i>some maner way</i>, some kind of way; cf. <i>what maner
  way</i>, A. L. 234.</p>

  <p>502. Refers to ll. 240, 249. With l. 510, cf. C. T., A 1027.</p>

  <p>512. Speght prints <i>bowes</i> for <i>boughes</i>; but the meaning is
  certain, as the reference is to ll. 270-1. Bows are not made of laurel;
  yet Dryden fell into the trap, and actually wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur's reign;</p>
      <p>Twelve they, and twelve the peers of Charlemagne;</p>
      <p>For bows the strength of brawny arms imply,</p>
      <p>Emblems of valour and of victory.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is probably the only instance, even in poetry, of knights being
  armed with bows and arrows.</p>

  <p>515. For the knights of Arthur's round table, see Malory's Morte
  Arthure.</p>

  <p>516. <i>Douseperes</i>; <i>les douze pers</i>, the twelve peers of
  Charlemagne, including Roland, Oliver, Ogier the Dane, Otuel, Ferumbras,
  the traitor Ganelon, and others. The names vary.</p>

  <p>520. <i>in hir tyme</i>, formerly, in their day; shewing that the
  institution of the Knights of the Garter on April 23, 1349, by Edward
  III, was anything but a recent event.</p>

  <p>530. I. e. 'Witness <i>him</i> of Rome, who was the founder of
  knighthood.' Alluding to Julius Cæsar, to whom was decreed by the senate
  the right of wearing a laurel-crown; Dryden mentions him by name.</p>

  <p>For numerous references to this poem, see Notes to the preceding
  poem.</p>

  <p>Though apparently written by the authoress of the Flower and the Leaf,
  it is of later date, and much less use is made of the final <i>e</i>.
  That the author was a woman, is asserted in ll. 7, 18, 259, 284, 370,
  379-85, 407, 450, 625.</p>

  <p>17. <i>the mase</i>. They amused themselves by trying to find a way
  into a maze, similar to that at Hampton Court. Cf. l. 32.</p>

  <p>29. Ll. 1-28 are introductory. The story of the dream now begins, but
  is likewise preceded by an introduction, down to l. 77.</p>

  <p>34. The word <i>went</i> is repeated; the second time, it is an error
  for <i>wend</i>, weened. 'Some went (really) inwards, and imagined that
  they had gone outwards.' Which shews that the maze was well constructed.
  So, in l. 36, those who thought they were far behind, found themselves as
  far forward as the best of them.</p>

  <p>42. That is, they cheated the deviser of the maze, by stepping over
  the rail put to strengthen the hedge. That was because they lost their
  temper.</p>

  <p>44. The authoress got ahead of the rest; although sorely tired, she
  had gained a great advantage, and found the last narrow passage which led
  straight to the arbour in the centre. This was provided with benches
  (doubtless of turf, Flower and Leaf, l. 51) and well enclosed, having
  stone walls and a paved floor with a fountain in the middle of it.</p>

  <p>54. There were stairs leading downwards, with a 'turning-wheel.' I do
  not think that turning-wheel here means a turn-stile, or what was
  formerly called a turn-pike. It simply means that the stair-case was of
  spiral form. Jamieson tells us that, in Lowland Scotch, the term
  <i>turn-pike</i> was applied (1) to the winding stair of a castle, and
  (2) to any set of stairs of spiral form; and quotes from Arnot to shew
  that a spiral stair-case was called a <i>turnpike stair</i>, whereas a
  straight one was called a <i>scale stair</i>. The pot of marjoram may
  have been placed on a support rising from the newel.</p>

  <p>It may be noted that arbours, which varied greatly in size and
  construction, were often set upon a small 'mount' or mound; in which case
  it would be easy to make a small spiral stair-case in the centre. In the
  present case, it could hardly have been very large, as it occupied a
  space in the centre of a maze. For further illustration, see A History of
  Gardening in England, by the Hon. Alicia Amherst, pp. 33, 52, 78, 116,
  118, 314.</p>

  <p>60. 'And how they (the daisies) were accompanied with other flowers
  besides, viz. forget-me-nots and remember-mes; and the poor pansies were
  not ousted from the place.'</p>

  <p>61. <i>Ne-m'oublie-mies</i>; from O.F. <i>ne m'oublie-mie</i>, a
  forget-me-not. Littré, s.v. <i>ne m'oubliez pas</i>, quotes, from Charles
  d'Orléans, 'Des <!-- Page 536 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page536"></a>[536]</span>fleurs de <i>ne m'oubliez mie</i>'; and
  again, from a later source, 'Un diamant taillé en fleur de <i>ne m'oblie
  mie</i>.' The recovery of this true reading (by the help of MS. A.) is
  very interesting; as all the editions, who follow Thynne, are hopelessly
  wrong. Thynne, misreading the word, printed <i>Ne momblysnesse</i>;
  whence arose the following extraordinary entry in Bailey's
  Dictionary:&mdash;'<i>Momblishness</i>, talk, muttering; Old Word.' This
  ghost-word is carefully preserved in the Century Dictionary in the
  form:&mdash;'<i>Momblishness</i>, muttering talk; Bailey (1731).'</p>

  <p><i>sovenez</i> doubtless corresponds to the name <i>remember-me</i>,
  given in Yorkshire and Scotland to the <i>Veronica chamædrys</i>, more
  commonly called the germander speedwell, and in some counties
  forget-me-not. But we should rather, in this passage, take forget-me-not
  (above) to refer, as is most usual, to the <i>Myosotis</i>; as Littré
  also explains it. Here Thynne was once more at a loss, and printed the
  word as <i>souenesse</i>, which was 'improved' by Stowe into
  <i>sonenesse</i>. Hence another ghost-word, recorded by Bailey in the
  entry:&mdash;'<i>Sonenesse</i>, noise.' Cf. l. 86.</p>

  <p>62. <i>pensees</i>, pansies; alluding, of course, to the <i>Viola
  tricolor</i>. The spelling is correct, as it represents the O.F.
  <i>pensee</i>, thought; and it seems to have been named, as Littré
  remarks, in a similar way to the forget-me-not, and (I may add) to the
  remember-me.</p>

  <p>68. <i>stremes</i>, jets of water; there was a little fountain in the
  middle.</p>

  <p>73. The authoress had to wait till the other ladies also arrived in
  the centre of the maze. Cf. note to l. 736.</p>

  <p>82. <i>sad</i>, settled, staid. <i>demure</i>, sober; lit. mature.</p>

  <p>83. <i>blewe</i>, blue; which was the colour of constancy; see note to
  C. T., F 644 (vol. v. p. 386). For the lady's name was Perseverance. It
  is convenient to enumerate here the officers who are mentioned. They are:
  Perseveraunce, usher (91); Diligence (133, 198, 728); Countenance, porter
  (177, 277, 295); Discretion, purveyour (263); Acquaintance, herbergeour
  (269); Largesse, steward (318); Belchere, marshall (322); Remembrance,
  chamberlain (336); Avyseness, or Advisedness, secretary (343); and
  Attemperance, chancellor (508). The chief Lady is Loyalty (98), dwelling
  in the mansion of Pleasant Regard (170).</p>

  <p>87. Here <i>word</i> means 'motto.' I here collect the French mottoes
  mentioned, viz. Bien et loyalement (88); Tant que je puis (208); A moi
  que je voy (308); Plus ne purroy (364); A endurer (489). Afterwards, four
  ladies are introduced, with the mottoes Sans que jamais (583); Une sanz
  chaungier (590); Oncques puis lever (598); and Entierment vostre (616).
  These ladies afterwards present petitions, on which were written,
  respectively, the phrases Cest sanz dire (627); En dieu est (645); Soyez
  en sure (666); and Bien moneste (675). The words, or mottoes, were
  embroidered on the sleeves of the ladies (119). See Lydgate's Temple of
  Glas, 308-10.</p>

  <p>224. They said a pater-noster for the benefit of St. Julian, because
  <!-- Page 537 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page537"></a>[537]</span>he was the patron-saint of wayfarers. 'Of
  this saynt Julyen somme saye that this is he that pylgryms and wey-faryng
  men calle and requyre for good herberowe, by-cause our lord was lodgyd in
  his hows'; Caxton's Golden Legend. The story occurs in the Gesta
  Romanorum, c. xviii., and in the Aurea Legenda. The following extract
  from an old translation of Boccaccio, Decam. Day 2. Nov. 2, explains the
  point of the allusion. 'Nevertheless, at all times, when I am thus in
  journey, in the morning before I depart my chamber, I say a
  <i>pater-noster</i> and an <i>Ave-Maria</i> for the souls of the father
  and mother of St. Julian; and after that, I pray God and St. Julian to
  send me a good lodging at night'; &amp;c. Dunlop, in his Hist. of
  Fiction, discussing this Novella, says: 'This saint was originally a
  knight, and, as was prophecied to him by a stag, he had the singular hap
  to kill his father and mother by mistake. As an atonement for his
  carelessness, he afterwards founded a sumptuous hospital for the
  accommodation of travellers, who, in return for their entertainment, were
  required to <i>repeat pater-nosters</i> for the souls of his unfortunate
  parents.'</p>

  <p>241. Because she was to change her dress, and put on blue; see ll.
  258-9, 313-4, 413.</p>

  <p>457. The reference is to the Legend of Good Women, which contains the
  story of Phyllis, Thisbe, and 'Cleopataras.' Cf. l. 465.</p>

  <p>463. <i>Hawes</i>, probably the same name as <i>Havise</i>, which
  occurs in the old story of Fulke Fitzwarine. But it is remarkable that
  MS. A. has the reading:&mdash;'That other sydë was, how Enclusene'; and
  this looks like an error for <i>Melusene</i>, variant of <i>Melusine</i>.
  This would agree with the next line, which means 'was untruly deceived in
  her bath.' The story of Melusine is given in the Romance of Partenay. She
  was a fairy who married Raymound, son of the Earl of Forest, on the
  understanding that he was never to watch what she did on a Saturday. This
  he at last attempts to do, and discovers, through a hole in the door,
  that she was <i>in a bath</i>, and that her lower half was changed into a
  serpent. He tries to keep the knowledge of the secret, but one day, in a
  fit of anger, calls her a serpent. She reproaches him, and vanishes from
  his sight. See the Romans of Partenay, ed. Skeat (E.E.T.S.).</p>

  <p>465. From Chaucer's poem of Anelida and the false Arcite; vol. i. p.
  365; for her Complaint, see the same, p. 373.</p>

  <p>471. <i>umple</i> (MS. T. <i>vmpylle</i>), smooth gauze; from O.F.
  <i>omple</i>, smooth, used as an epithet of cloth, satin, or other stuff
  (Godefroy). Here evidently applied to something of a very thin texture,
  as gauze; see l. 473.</p>

  <p>477. <i>stages</i>, steps. The chair or throne was set on a platform
  accessible by five steps, which were made of <i>cassidony</i>. Cotgrave
  explains O.F. <i>cassidonie</i> as meaning not only <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'chaledony'.">chalcedony</span>,
  but also a kind of marble; and this latter sense may be here
  intended.</p>

  <p>488. <i>Her word</i>, her motto; <i>her</i> must refer to the great
  lady (l. 501) to whom the throne belonged. <!-- Page 538 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>[538]</span></p>

  <p>499. <i>tapet</i>, a hanging cloth (Halliwell); here a portion of the
  hangings that could be lifted up, to give entrance.</p>

  <p>526. <i>After a sort</i>, of one kind, alike. <i>vent</i>, slit in
  front of a gown. '<i>Vente</i>, the opening at the neck of the tunic or
  gown, as worn by both sexes during the Norman period, and which was
  closed by a brooch'; Gloss. to Fairholt's Costume in England. O.F.
  <i>fente</i>, a slit, cleft; from Lat. <i>findere</i>. The collar and
  slit were alike bordered with ermine, covered with large pearls, and
  sprinkled with diamonds. Cf. also: 'Wyth armynes powdred bordred at the
  vent'; Hawes, Pastime of Pleasure, ed. Wright, p. 80.</p>

  <p>536. <i>balays</i>, a balas-ruby; 'a delicate rose-red variety of the
  spinel ruby'; New. E. Dict. <i>of entail</i>, lit. 'of cutting,' i.e.
  carefully cut; the usual phrase; see New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>539. <i>a world</i>, worth a world; cf. <i>a world</i> (great
  quantity) of ladies; Flower and the Leaf, 137.</p>

  <p>576-8. Alluding to the proverb: 'first come, first served'; cf. C. T.,
  D 389, and the note (vol. v. p. 301).</p>

  <p>581. We find that the 'bills' are petitions made by the four ladies
  regarding their ill success in love-affairs.</p>

  <p>592. I. e. yet not so much as she ought to have been, as she had all
  the trouble; <i>she</i> refers to the lady herself.</p>

  <p>598. <i>Oncques</i>, ever; Lat. <i>unquam</i>. 'I can ever rise' seems
  at first sight to be meant; but <i>ne</i> must be understood; the true
  sense is, 'I can never rise'; i.e. never succeed. See the context, ll.
  605-9.</p>

  <p>645. 'I trust in God'; see l. 655.</p>

  <p>675. 'Admonish well'; from O.F. <i>monester</i>, to admonish,
  warn.</p>

  <p>680. Here, and in l. 689, the speaker is the lady of the castle. In l.
  682 (as in l. 690), the speaker appears to be the fourth lady; it is none
  too clear.</p>

  <p>689. <i>I hate you</i>, I command you. <i>Hate</i> should rather be
  written <i>hote</i>; perhaps it was confused with the related pt. t.
  <i>hatte</i>, was called. The reference to Saint James of Compostella is
  noteworthy.</p>

  <p>693. <i>it</i>, i.e. the bill, or petition; it takes the form of a
  Complaint.</p>

  <p>697-8. <i>And</i>, if. <i>ye wolde</i>, i.e. <i>ye wolde seme</i>,
  (see l. 696), ye would think so. <i>Seem</i> is still common in
  Devonshire in the sense of think or suppose; usually pronounced
  <i>zim</i>.</p>

  <p>699. <i>her</i> refers to the lady of the castle; at least, it would
  appear so from l. 705. Else, it refers to Fortune.</p>

  <p>736. <i>the water</i>, water thrown in her face by one of her
  companions, who had by this time entered the arbour.</p>

  <p>752. A headless line; accent the first syllable.</p>

  <p>754-5. The Flower and the Leaf has a similar ending (ll. 582-3). <!--
  Page 539 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page539"></a>[539]</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece22">XXII. A GOODLY BALADE.</a></p>

  <p>Obviously Lydgate's. See the Introduction.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Moder of norture</i>, model of good breeding. The poem is
  evidently addressed to a lady named Margaret.</p>

  <p>2. <i>flour</i>, daisy (for Margaret); see ll. 22, 23.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Al be I</i>, although I am; common in Lydgate.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Thing</i>, i.e. anything, everything, whatever thing.</p>

  <p>15. <i>Mieulx un</i>, one (is) better; evidently cited from a motto or
  device. The meaning seems to be: it is better to have but <i>one</i>
  lover, and you have found one in a heart that will never shrink. In the
  Temple of Glas, 310, Lydgate uses the motto <i>de mieulx en
  mieulx</i>.</p>

  <p>22-3. 'Daisy (born) of light; you are called the daughter of the sun.'
  Alluding to the name <i>day's eye</i>, which was also applied by Lydgate
  to the sun; see note in vol. iii. p. 291 (l. 43). Imitated from Legend of
  Good Women, 60-4.</p>

  <p>29. 'When the day dawns, (repairing) to its natural place (in the
  east), then your father Ph&oelig;bus adorns the morrow.'</p>

  <p>34. 'Were it not for the comfort in the day-time, when (the sun's)
  clear eyes make the daisy unclose.' Awkward and involved; cf. Legend of
  Good Women, 48-50, 64-5.</p>

  <p>43. <i>Je vouldray</i>, I should like; purposely left incomplete.</p>

  <p>44. <i>casuel</i>, uncertain; see New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>48-9. <i>god saith</i>; implying that it is in the Bible. I do not
  find the words; cf. Prov. xxi. 3; 1 Pet. ii. 20.</p>

  <p>50. <i>Cautels</i>, artifices, deceits; a word not used by Chaucer,
  but found in Lydgate; see New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>57. <i>Quaketh my penne</i>, my pen quakes; an expression used once by
  Chaucer, Troil. iv. 13, but pounced upon by Lydgate, who employs it
  repeatedly. See more than twenty examples in Schick's note to the Temple
  of Glas, 947. Cf. IX. 229.</p>

  <p>59. Read <i>roseth</i>, grows rosy, grows red, as opposed to
  <i>welkeneth</i>, withers, fades. We find the pp. <i>rosed</i> twice in
  Shakespeare; 'a maid yet <i>rosed over</i>,' Henry V, v. 2. 423; and 'thy
  <i>rosed</i> lips'; Titus And. ii. 4. 24. The emendation seems a safe
  one, for it restores the sense as well as the rime.</p>

  <p><i>welkeneth</i> should probably be <i>welketh</i>; I find no other
  example of the verb <i>welkenen</i>, though <i>welwen</i> occurs in a
  like sense; and <i>welketh</i> suits the rhythm.</p>

  <p>60. <i>eft</i>, once again hot. These sudden transitions from cold to
  heat are common; see Temple of Glas, 356:&mdash;'For thoughe I brenne
  with <i>feruence</i> and with hete.'</p>

  <p>64. Lydgate is always deploring his lack of eloquence; cf. notes to
  Temple of Glas, ed. Schick, ll. 1393, 1400.</p>

  <p>69. I can find no such word as <i>jouesse</i>, so I alter it to
  <i>jonesse</i>, i.e. youth. For the spelling <i>jonesce</i> in the 14th
  century, see Littré, s.v. <!-- Page 540 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page540"></a>[540]</span><i>jeunesse</i>. The expression <i>have
  more yet</i> implies that the phrase or motto <i>je serve jonesse</i> is
  added as a postscript, and that there was some special point in it; but
  the application of it is now lost to us. Cf. 'Princes <i>of youthe</i>,
  and flour of gentilesse,' Temple of Glas, 970.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece23">XXIII. GO FORTH, KING.</a></p>

  <p>This poem really consists of twelve precepts, intended to redress
  twelve abuses. The twelve abuses are given by the Latin lines above,
  which should be compared throughout. The whole poem is thus easily
  understood.</p>

  <p>The accent is on the first syllable of the line in most of the lines.
  In l. 3, the word <i>Lord</i> stands alone in the first foot. The lines
  are somewhat unsteady, quite in Lydgate's usual manner. In l. 6,
  <i>jug-e</i> is probably dissyllabic. See further in the
  Introduction.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece24">XXIV. THE COURT OF LOVE.</a></p>

  <p>This late piece abounds with imitations of Lydgate, especially of his
  Temple of Glas; many of the resemblances are pointed out in Schick's
  edition of that poem, which I refer to by the contraction 'T. G.'</p>

  <p>1. Cf. 'With quaking hert[e] of myn inward drede'; T. G. 978.</p>

  <p>'Another feature characteristic of Lydgate is his self-deprec[i]atory
  vein'; T. G., Introd. p. cxl. We have here an instance of an imitation of
  it.</p>

  <p>6. Cf. 'Save that he wol conveyen his matere'; C. T., E 55.</p>

  <p>8. He refers to Cicero's flowers of rhetoric. He may have found the
  name in Chaucer, P. F. 31. But he probably took the whole idea from a
  line of Lydgate's:&mdash;'Of rethoriques <i>Tullius</i> fond the
  <i>floures</i>': Minor Poems, p. 87.</p>

  <p>9. <i>borne</i>, burnish, adorn; it rimes (as here) with
  <i>sojorne</i> in Troil. i. 327.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Galfrid</i>, Geoffrey de Vinsauf; his 'craft' refers to his
  treatise on the art of poetry, entitled 'Nova Poetria'; see note to C.
  T., B 4537 (vol. v. p. 257). [I once thought (see vol. i. p. 43) that
  <i>Galfrid</i> here means Chaucer himself, as he also is twice called
  <i>Galfrid</i> in Lydgate's Troy-book. But I find that Dr. Schick thinks
  otherwise, and the use of the word <i>craft</i> is on his side. At the
  same time, this renders it impossible for Chaucer to have written 'The
  Court of Love'; <i>his</i> opinion of his namesake was the reverse of
  reverential.] With ll. 4-11 compare the opening lines of Benedict Burgh's
  Poem in Praise of Lydgate, pr. at p. xxxi of Steele's edition of
  Lydgate's Secrees of Philosophers.</p>

  <p>19. <i>Calliope</i>; twice mentioned by Chaucer; also by Lydgate, T.
  G. 1303. Lydgate's Troy-book opens with an invocation to Mars, followed
  by one to Calliope:&mdash;'Helpe me also, o thou Callyope'; and only <!--

  lines above there is a mention of 'Helicon the welle' (see l. 22
  below).</p>

  <p>22. <i>Elicon</i>, mount Helicon in B&oelig;otia, sacred to Apollo and
  the Muses; confused by Chaucer and his followers with the fountain
  Hippocrene; see note in vol. i. p. 531. Hence Lydgate's expression
  'Helicon the welle' in the last note and in T. G. 706, and the reference
  in the text to its <i>dropes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>suger-dropes</i>; Lydgate was fond of sugar; he has 'soote
  <i>sugred</i> armonye,' Minor Poems, p. 182; and '<i>sugrid</i> melody,'
  ib., p. 11. Also '<i>sugred</i> eloquence'; XII. 200 (p. 288); with which
  cf. l. 933 below. I have observed several other examples.</p>

  <p>24. <i>Melpomene</i>; the muse who presided over tragedy.</p>

  <p>28. Cf. 'This simpil tretis for to take <i>in gre</i>'; T. G. 1387.
  'Taketh <i>at gre</i> the rudness of my style'; Lydgate, Secrees of
  Philosophers, 21.</p>

  <p>30. <i>metriciens</i>, skilful in metre, poets; a word which has a
  remarkably late air about it. Richardson gives an example of it from
  Hall's Chronicle.</p>

  <p>36. Compare the following, from T. G. 1379-81.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'I purpos here to maken and to write</p>
      <p>A litil tretise, and a processe make</p>
      <p>In pris of women, oonli for hir sake.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>40. <i>man</i>, servant, one who does her homage; cf. Chaucer, C. T.,
  I 772; La Belle Dame, 244; T. G. 742.</p>

  <p>42. Cf. 'So that here-after my ladi may it <i>loke</i>'; T. G.
  1392.</p>

  <p>45. Cf. 'Ther was enclosed <i>rype and sad corage</i>'; C. T., E
  220.</p>

  <p>49, 50. Here the mountain of Cithæron, in B&oelig;otia, is confused
  with the island of Cythera, sacred to Venus, whence her name Cytherea was
  derived. The mistake arose, of course, from the similarity of the names,
  and occurs (as said in vol. v. p. 78, note to A 1936), in the Roman de la
  Rose, where we find:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Citeron est une montaigne ...</p>
      <p>Venus, qui les dames espire,</p>
      <p>Fist là son principal manoir'; ll. 15865-71.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hence Chaucer makes the same confusion, but in a different way.
  Chaucer preserves the right name of the mountain, in the form
  <i>Citheroun</i>, which he rimes with <i>mencioun</i> (A 1936) and with
  <i>Adoun</i> (A 2223); but here we have the form <i>Citharee</i>, riming
  with <i>see</i>. For all this, the scribe corrects it to <i>Citheron</i>
  in l. 69, where he has no rime to deal with.</p>

  <p>56. Cf. 'the <i>winged</i> god, Mercurie'; C. T., A 1385.</p>

  <p>58. The MS. has <i>costes that it drewe</i>; Bell alters this to
  <i>had to it drew</i>, under the impression that <i>drew</i> is the pp.
  of <i>draw</i>! So again, in l. 78, he alters <i>saphir ind</i>, which is
  correct, to <i>saphir of Inde</i>; and <!-- Page 542 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page542"></a>[542]</span>in general, alters the
  text at will without the least hint that he has done so.</p>

  <p>78. <i>ind</i>, blue; as in The Black Knight, 127.</p>

  <p>80. <i>Baleis Turkeis</i> (MS. <i>Bales turkes</i>). <i>Baleis</i> is
  a better spelling, answering to F. <i>balais</i> in Littré. It also
  occurs as <i>balai</i> in O.F.; and the word was probably suggested by
  the mention of it in Rom. de la Rose, 20125:&mdash;'Que saphirs, rubis,
  ne <i>balai</i>.' Hence also the mention of it in the King's Quhair, st.
  46, which see; and in the Assembly of Ladies, 536. <i>Turkeis</i> is the
  A. F. equivalent of O.F. <i>Turkois</i>, i.e. Turkish, as in C. T., A
  2895, on which see the note (vol. v. p. 93).</p>

  <p>81. <i>shene</i>, a misspelling of <i>shine</i>, intimating that the
  author has confused the adj. <i>shene</i> with the verb; or rather, that
  the poem was written at a time when the word <i>shine</i> could be used
  as riming to <i>been</i>; since we find similar examples in lines 561,
  768. So also we find <i>pretily</i> riming with <i>be</i> in The Flower
  and the Leaf, 89. The pt. t. <i>shoon</i> occurs in l. 83.</p>

  <p>82. Cf. 'As doon the sterres in the frosty night'; C. T., A 268. And
  again: '<i>bryght As sterrys in</i> the <i>wyntyr</i> nyght'; Lydgate,
  Compleint following T. G., l. 548.</p>

  <p>86. Cf. Compl. of Mars, 78-84, 104-5; C. T., A 2388 (and note); and T.
  G. 126-8.</p>

  <p>88. Cf. 'Long as <i>a mast</i>,' &amp;c.; C. T., A 3264.</p>

  <p>92. Cf. Troil. iii. 8-21: '<i>In hevene and helle</i>,' &amp;c.; from
  Boccaccio; see note (vol. ii. p. 475).</p>

  <p>105. <i>Alceste</i>; evidently borrowed from Ch., Legend of Good
  Women, 224, 293-9, 432; cf. T. G. 70-4. <i>The quenes flour Alceste</i> =
  the flower of queen Alcestis; a common idiom; see note to C. T., F 209
  (vol. v. p. 376).</p>

  <p>107. <i>Admete</i>, Admetus; see Troil. i. 664, and the note; T. G.
  72.</p>

  <p>108. <i>ninetene</i>; copied from the Legend of Good Women, 283; just
  as the next line is from the same, 285-9. This is the more remarkable,
  because Chaucer never finished the poem, but mentions ten ladies only, in
  nine Legends. Cf. 'the book of <i>the nynetene Ladies</i>'; C. T., I
  1086. Hawes also refers to Chaucer's 'tragidyes ... of the xix. ladyes';
  Pastime of Pleasure, ed. Wright, p. 53.</p>

  <p>115. 'So fair was noon in alle Arras'; R. R. 1234.</p>

  <p>116. <i>of esier availe</i>, of less value; see <i>Avail</i> in the
  New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>117. <i>saunz faile</i>; thrice in Ch.; HF. 188, 429; C. T., B
  501.</p>

  <p>119. <i>Helisee</i>, Elysium; '<i>the feld</i> ... That hight
  <i>Elysos</i>'; Troil. iv. 789.</p>

  <p>120. <i>saintes</i>, saints, martyrs for love; cf. V. 316, above (p.
  227), and the note. Cf. T. G. 414.</p>

  <p>129. 'The king had Danger standing near him, and the queen had
  Disdain, who were chief of the council, to treat of affairs of state';
  Bell.</p>

  <p>138. Cf. T. G. 271, and the note, shewing how common gold hair is in
  Lydgate. <!-- Page 543 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page543"></a>[543]</span></p>

  <p>139, 140. 'Bihinde <i>her bak, a yerde long</i>'; C. T., A 1050.</p>

  <p>148. <i>In mewet</i>, in an inaudible voice, to myself; like mod. F.
  <i>à la muette</i> (Littré).</p>

  <p>167. <i>non erst</i>; false grammar for <i>non er</i>, no sooner; 'no
  soonest' is nonsense. We find, however, the phrases <i>not erst</i> and
  <i>never erst</i> elsewhere; see New E. Dict., s.v. <i>Erst</i>, § B.
  4.</p>

  <p>170. This is the earliest quotation given in the New E. Dict., s.v.
  <i>Assummon</i>; and the next is from the poet Daniel.</p>

  <p>177. Chaucer has the compound <i>for-pampred</i>; Former Age, 5. I
  read <i>jolif</i>, joyful, to make sense; the MS. has the absurd word
  <i>ioylof</i> (<i>sic</i>); and Stowe has <i>ialous</i>, jealous, which
  is quite out of place here.</p>

  <p>181. 'An allusion to the monkish story of the man who brought up a
  youth ignorant of women, and who, when he first saw them, told him they
  were geese. The story is in the <i>Promptuarium Exemplorum</i>. It was
  adopted by Boccaccio, from whom it was taken by Lafontaine, liv. iii.
  conte 1. See <i>Latin Stories</i>, edited by Mr. &#x1E6C;
  Wright.'&mdash;Bell.</p>

  <p>194. From C. T., B 466: '<i>On many a</i> sory <i>meel</i> now <i>may
  she bayte</i>.'</p>

  <p>202. Cf. '<i>Comfort is noon</i>'; Chaucer's A B C, 17.</p>

  <p>207. <i>how</i>, however. Cf. 'that <i>boghten love</i> so
  <i>dere</i>'; Legend of Good Women, 258.</p>

  <p>229. See the Book of the Duchess, 323-34, where the painted glass
  windows contain subjects from the Romance of the Rose and others. The
  story of Dido is common enough; but the reference to Chaucer's Anelida
  and the false Arcite, is remarkable, especially as it occurs also in XXI.
  465 above (p. 395). 'The turtel trewe' is from the Parl. Foules, 577. See
  the parallel passage in T. G. 44-142, where Lydgate's <i>first</i>
  example is that of <i>Dido</i>, while at the same time he mentions
  Palamon, Emilie, and Canacee, all from Chaucer.</p>

  <p>246. <i>blew</i>, blue, the colour of constancy; see l. 248.</p>

  <p>250. 'And why that ye ben clothed thus <i>in blak</i>?' C. T., A
  911.</p>

  <p>255. <i>grene</i> only gives an assonance with <i>here</i>, not a
  rime. Green was the colour of inconstancy, and was sometimes used <i>for
  despyt</i>, to use Chaucer's phrase; see note to C. T., F 644 (vol. v. p.
  386). White may refer to the White Friars or Carmelites, and russet to
  the hermits; cf. P. Plowman, C. prol. 3, C. xi. 1.</p>

  <p>270. <i>an ho</i>, a proclamation commanding silence; see C. T., 2533.
  Quite distinct from <i>hue</i> (and cry), with which Bell confuses it. A
  hue and cry was only raised against fleeing criminals.</p>

  <p>280. Clearly suggested by the God of Love's stern question in the
  Legend of Good Women, 315:&mdash;'What dostow heer So nigh myn owne
  flour, so boldely?' At the same time the phrase <i>fer y-stope in
  yeres</i> is from Chaucer's <i>somdel stape in age</i>, C. T., B 4011, on
  which see the note (vol. v. p. 248). See the next note.</p>

  <p>288. Similarly the God of Love pardoned Chaucer (L. G. W. 450), but
  upon a condition (ib. 548).</p>

  <p>290. <i>serven</i>, false grammar for <i>serve</i>. <!-- Page 544
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page544"></a>[544]</span></p>

  <p>302. Here follow the twenty statutes; ll. 302-504. They are evidently
  expanded from the similar set of injunctions given by Venus to the Knight
  in The Temple of Glas, ll. 1152-213; as clearly shewn by Schick in his
  Introduction, p. cxxxi. The similarity extends to the first, second,
  third, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, twelfth, fourteenth and
  eighteenth statutes, which resemble passages found in the Temple of Glas,
  ll. 1152-213, or elsewhere in the same poem. It is also possible that the
  author, or Lydgate, or both of them, kept an eye upon Ovid's Art of Love.
  See also Rom. Rose (Eng. version), 2355-950, which is much to the
  point.</p>

  <p>305. This is also the first injunction in T. G. 1152-3, and is
  immediately followed by the second, which enjoins <i>secrecy</i>. The
  reader should compare the passages for himself.</p>

  <p>311. MS. <i>synk and flete</i>; which must of course be corrected to
  'sink <i>or</i> flete,' as in Anelida, 182; C. T., A 2397.</p>

  <p>317. '<i>Withoute chaunge</i> in parti or in al'; T. G. 1155.</p>

  <p>319. The MS. has <i>brynde</i>, and Stowe has <i>brinde</i>; so I let
  the reading stand. Morris has <i>blynde</i>, and Bell <i>blind</i>;
  neither of them has a note as to the change made. Perhaps <i>brind</i> =
  <i>brend</i> = burnt, in the sense of 'inflamed by passion'; or it may be
  an error for <i>brim</i> = <i>breme</i>, furious, applied especially to
  the desire of the boar for the sow. The sense intended is clear enough;
  we should now write 'base.'</p>

  <p>324-5. From C. T., A 2252-3:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p>I wol don sacrifice, and <i>fyres bete</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>329. <i>passe forby</i>, to pass by, i.e. to get out of his way; cf.
  C. T., B 1759, C 668. <i>an ese</i>, a relief, a way of escape. There is
  no difficulty, but all the editions have altered it to <i>passe, for
  thereby</i>, which will not scan.</p>

  <p>330. <i>daungerous</i>, grudging, reluctant; see C. T., D 514.</p>

  <p>332. <i>of a sight</i>, of what one may see. <i>squeymous</i> (MS.
  <i>squymouse</i>, Stowe <i>squmous</i>), squeamish, particular; see note
  to C. T., A 3337 (vol. v. p. 102). It is added that when the lady, on her
  part, was cruel, it was the lover's duty to toss about in bed and weep;
  cf. T. G. 12:&mdash;'The longe nyght <i>walowing</i> to and fro.' 'To
  <i>walwe and wepe</i>'; Troil. i. 699. And see Rom. Rose (Eng. version),
  2553-62.</p>

  <p>338. Cf. 'Him to complein, that he walk [<i>read</i> welk = walked] so
  sole'; T. G. 552. And cf. Book Duch. 449; Black Knight, 143; Rom. Rose,
  2391-6, 2517-9.</p>

  <p>340. Cf. 'as though he roughte nought Of life ne deth'; T. G.

  <p>344. 'Abide awhile,' T. G. 1203; '<i>patiently</i> t'endure'; T. G.
  1267.</p>

  <p>347. <i>helden</i>, false grammar for <i>held</i>. The metre shews
  that it was intentional.</p>

  <p>349. 'Fulli <i>to obeye</i>,' T. G. 1151; cf. 1145-50. <!-- Page 545
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page545"></a>[545]</span></p>

  <p>360-4. Cf. T. G. 1012-25; especially 'And when I trespas, goodli me
  correcte'; and 'neuyr yow offende.' And Ovid, Art. Amat. lib. ii.
  199-202.</p>

  <p>367. <i>yern</i>, earn; so <i>yearne</i> in Spenser, F. Q. vi. 1. 40;
  A.S. <i>geearnian</i>.</p>

  <p>368-9. 'Of <i>grace and pitè</i>, and nought of rightwisnes'; T. G.
  979.</p>

  <p>378. <i>a-croke</i> (MS. <i>a croke</i>), awry; see <i>Acrook</i> in
  the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>379-81. In l. 381, the MS. has <i>shon</i> (shun) distinctly; yet
  Morris prints <i>shoue</i>, and Stowe <i>showe</i>, destroying the sense.
  All have <i>knowe</i> in l. 379, but it should rather be <i>con</i>,
  which gives a perfect rime; for <i>con</i> represents A.S. <i>cunnan</i>,
  to know, and is frequently spelt <i>cun</i>; see <i>Con</i> in the New E.
  Dict. This statute refers to 'the comfort of Sweet-Looking'; see Rom.
  Rose, 2893-922; Gower, C. A., iii. 26-7.</p>

  <p>390. See T. G. 170-1, 1014.</p>

  conciliatur amor'; Ovid, Art. Amat. lib. ii. 278.</p>

  <p>403. Cf. Rom. Rose, 2568-85.</p>

  <p>412. 'And for no tales thin herte not remue'; T. G. 1182. Cf. C. T., A
  3163-4; F 1483-5; and XII. 113-9 above (p. 289).</p>

  <p>429. 'For love ne wol nat countrepleted be'; Legend of Good Women,
  476. 'Quisquis erit cui favet illa, fave'; Ovid, Art. Amat. lib. i.
  146.</p>

  <p>431. '<i>Whyt</i> was this <i>crowe</i>'; C. T., H 133; cf. note to C.
  T., D 232.</p>

  <p>456. Compare the Merchant's Tale; C. T., E 1245.</p>

  <p>469. Cf. T. G. 1168-70: 'All trwe louers to relese of her payne,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>475. 'Ai fressh and wel besein'; T. G. 1167. Cf. Rom. Rose, 2279-84.
  'Munditiae placeant,' &amp;c.; Ovid, Art. Amat. lib. i. 513.</p>

  <p>484. 'Who loveth trewe hath no fatnesse'; Rom. Rose, 2686; 'Arguat et
  macies animum'; Ovid, Art. Amat. lib. i. 733.</p>

  <p>491-504. Cf. Rom. Rose, 2419-39, 2817-20. In particular, ll. 496-7
  seem to be actually copied from Rom. Rose, 2819-20: 'or of hir <i>chere
  That to thee made thy lady dere</i>.' This raises the suspicion that the
  Court of Love was written after 1532.</p>

  <p>499. <i>thou seen</i> would be in Latin <i>tu videatis</i>; another
  example of false grammar.</p>

  <p>523. <i>let been</i>, to let (them) be, to leave off.</p>

  <p>526. <i>kepten been</i> (MS. <i>bene</i>); so in all the copies; but
  <i>kepten</i> is the pt. t. plural, as if we should say in Latin
  <i>seruauerunt sunt</i>. Unless, indeed, the <i><span
  class="nw">-en</span></i> is meant for the pp. suffix of a strong verb,
  as if we should make a Latin form <i>seruatiti</i>. The scansion shews
  that this false grammar came from the author.</p>

  <p>529. 'Except God and the devil.'</p>

  <p>536-7. Solomon and Samson; the usual stock examples. But probably in
  this case borrowed from Lydgate's Balade, XIV. 4 (p. 295), which is
  certainly quoted thrice again below.</p>

  <p>542. This line is made up from Lydgate's Balade, XIV. 29-33, and 26;
  so again l. 544 resembles the same, l. 24. And Lydgate merely <!-- Page
  546 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page546"></a>[546]</span>versifies
  the medieval proverb: 'Fallere,' &amp;c.; see note to XIV. 29; p.
  516.</p>

  <p>547. <i>of kind</i>, by nature; as in XIV. 29 (p. 296).</p>

  <p>550. 'An housbond shal <i>nat been inquisitif</i>'; C. T., A 3163.</p>

  <p>556. <i>Citherea</i> is right; see l. 50; MS. and Stowe have
  <i>Cithera</i>.</p>

  <p>560. 'You that are provided already with a lady.'&mdash;Bell. Cf. l.
  561.</p>

  <p>561-3. <i>eke</i>, <i>lyke</i>, a permissible rime, at a time when
  <i>e</i> had gained the mod. E. sound. See note to l. 81 above.</p>

  <p>570. See T. G. 143-6. With l. 577, cf. T. G. 50.</p>

  <p>580. The reading <i>blisful</i> is certain; it is from T. G.
  328:&mdash;'O <i>blisful</i> sterre, persant and ful of light.' The
  author uses <i>persant</i> below, in l. 849.</p>

  </div>

  <p>586. <i>loves daunce</i>; see references in the Glossary to vol. vi.,
  s.v. <i>Daunce</i>.</p>

  <p>589. In T. G. 144, the lovers are only many a thousand; in the Kingis
  Quair, st. 78, they are 'mony a' million; here they are a thousand
  million. Such is evolution.</p>

  <p>591. '<i>redresse</i> is elegantly put for
  <i>redresser</i>';&mdash;Bell. Then let the credit of it be Lydgate's;
  cf. '<i>Redresse</i> of sorow, O Citheria'; T. G. 701.</p>

  <p>592. Bell prints <i>yheried</i>, which is obviously right; but he does
  not say that both the MS. and Stowe have <i>I hired</i>; see Troil. ii.
  973, iii. 7, 1804.</p>

  <p>593. <i>loves bond</i>; founded on Boethius, lib. ii. met. 8, but
  doubtless taken from Troil. iii. 1766; see note in vol. ii. p. 483.</p>

  <p>598, 603. 'Make him teschwe euere synne and vice'; T. G. 450.</p>

  <p>611-3. <i>Celsitude</i> and <i>pulcritude</i> are words that savour of
  the revival of learning. Such words are common in Dunbar, who uses both
  of them. For <i>celsitude</i>, see Dunbar, ed. Small, p. 271, 76, and p.
  325, 25; for <i>pulcritude</i>, see the same, p. 271, 74; p. 274, 2; p.
  279, 5. He even rimes them together; p. 271. Hawes also uses
  <i>pulchritude</i>; Pastime of Pleasure, ed. Wright, pp. 5, 18.</p>

  <p>614. Cf. '<i>Comparisoun may noon y-maked be</i>'; Legend of Good
  Women, 122.</p>

  <p>623. <i>fere</i>, fire (not fear); as in Troil. iii. 978.</p>

  <p>628. <i>Beseech</i>, to beseech; note the anachronism in using the
  French infin. <i>void-en</i> with a suffix, and the Eng. <i>beseech</i>
  with none at all.</p>

  <p>634. <i>ure</i>, destiny; from O.F. <i>eur</i>, Lat. <i>augurium</i>.
  A word that first appeared in Northern English; it occurs at least eight
  times in Barbour's Bruce. And in the Kingis Quair, st. 10, we have the
  whole phrase&mdash;'my fortúne and ure.' It is also used by Lydgate; see
  VIII. 151, 302, 482 (pp. 250, 254, 260). <!-- Page 547 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page547"></a>[547]</span></p>

  <p>641. An exact repetition of l. 633 above.</p>

  <p>642. Here, for a wonder, is an example of the final <i>e</i>; the
  author took the whole phrase 'In thilk-ë place' from some previous
  author; cf. 'In thilke places' (<i>sic</i>); Rom. Rose, 660 (Thynne).
  <i>sign</i>, assign.</p>

  <p>648. 'Bi god and be my trouthe'; T. G. 1011.</p>

  <p>683. '<i>And holden werre</i> alwey with chastitee'; C. T., A
  2236.</p>

  <p>684. <i>I kepen</i>; false grammar; equivalent to Lat. <i>ego
  curamus</i>.</p>

  <p>688. <i>yove</i>, gave; but in l. 690 the form is <i>gave</i>. I
  suspect that in l. 690, <i>gave</i> should be <i>gan</i>, and that
  <i>image</i> (for <i>images</i>) is to be taken as a genitive case; then
  the sense is&mdash;'And I began anon to ponder and weigh in my heart her
  image's fresh beauty.'</p>

  <p>701. The idea is due to Chaucer's Compleynt to Pity; cf. l. 1324.</p>

  <p>702. Cf. 'Him deyneth nat to <i>wreke him on a flye</i>'; Legend of
  Good Women, 381.</p>

  <p>703. <i>eke him</i>, him also; but perhaps read <i>ete him</i>.</p>

  <p>704. Cf. 'and tendre herte'; C. T., A 150.</p>

  <p>725. <i>springen</i>; false grammar, as it is a plural form.</p>

  <p>727. <i>endry</i>, suffer, endure; so again in l. 941. This ridiculous
  hybrid is rightly excluded from the New E. Dict., which gives, however,
  several similar formations. It was coined by prefixing the F. prefix
  <i>en-</i>, with an intensive force, to M.E. <i>drien</i>, variant of
  <i>dreogen</i>, to endure (A.S. <i>dr&#x113;ogan</i>), Lowl. Sc.
  <i>dree</i>. No other author uses it.</p>

  <p>732. <i>spede</i>, succeed; Stowe's alteration to <i>speke</i> is
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p>749. 'How are you the nearer for loving,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>751. <i>fayn</i>, put for <i>feyn</i>, i.e. feign, tell an
  untruth.</p>

  <p>755. <i>heth</i>, heath. Here, and in l. 757, the author refers to two
  occasions when he was in great danger of falling in love; but he does not
  go into details.</p>

  <p>768. Here we must read <i>ee</i> (eye) for the rime; in other cases it
  appears as <i>eye</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>y</i>, riming with words in <i><span
  class="nw">-y</span></i>. This points to a somewhat late date; see note
  to l. 81 above. As for <i>stremes</i>, it is Lydgate's word for glances
  of the eye; see T. G. 263, 582. And Lydgate had it from Chaucer, who
  mostly uses it of sunbeams, but twice applies it to the beams from the
  eyes of Criseyde; Troil. i. 305, iii. 129.</p>

  <p>782. <i>flawe</i>, generally explained as representing Lat.
  <i>flauus</i>, yellowish, or the O.F. <i>flave</i>, with the same sense.
  Her hair was gold, so her eyebrows may have been of a similar colour. I
  suspect that <i>flawe</i> was a Northern form; cf. <i>braw</i>, as a
  Northern variant of <i>brave</i>.</p>

  <p>783. <i>mene disseverance</i>, a moderate distance; evidently meant
  with reference to Criseyde, whose one demerit was that her eye-brows
  joined each other; Troil. v. 813.</p>

  <p>787. <i>milk-whyt path</i>, the galaxy, or milky way; but surely this
  is quite a unique application of it, viz. to the prominent ridge of
  Rosial's nose.</p>

  <p>789. <i>smaragde</i>, emerald. The eyes of Beatrice are called
  <i>smeraldi</i>; Dante, Purg. xxxi. 116. Juliet's nurse said that an
  eagle's eye was not so green as that of Paris; Romeo, iii. 5. 222. Eyes
  in Chaucer are <!-- Page 548 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page548"></a>[548]</span>usually 'as gray as glas'; the O.F.
  <i>vair</i>, an epithet for eyes, meant grayish-blue.</p>

  <p>797. <i>basse</i>, kiss, buss; see <i>Bass</i> in the New E. Dict.
  <i>ben</i> is yet another instance of a false concord; read <i>be</i>, as
  <i>basse</i> is singular. See next note.</p>

  <p>798. Cornelius Maximianus Gallus, a poet of the sixth century, wrote
  six elegies which have come down to us. The quotation referred to occurs
  in the first Elegy (ll. 97-8), which is also quoted by Chaucer; see note
  to C. T., C 727 (vol. v. p. 287). The lines are:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'Flammea dilexi, modicumque tumentia labra,</p>
      <p>Quae mihi gustanti basia plena darent.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hence the epithet <i>Flaming</i> in l. 793.</p>

  <p>810. <i>bend</i>, a band, sash; see New E. Dict., s.v. <i>Bend</i>
  (2), sb., 1. a.</p>

  <p>811. 'With hair in tresses'; like Criseyde's; see Troil. v. 810.</p>

  <p>813. Cf. the Assembly of Ladies, 533-4 (p. 397):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'<i>Aboute her nekke</i> a sort of faire <i>rubyes</i></p>
      <p>In whyte <i>floures</i> of right fyne enamayl.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>See also the Kingis Quair, st. 48.</p>

  <p>815-6. See my note to Ch. Minor Poems, XXI. 20 (vol. i. p. 566).</p>

  <p>821. <i>Calixto</i>, Callisto; called <i>Calixte</i> in Parl. Foules,
  286. The story is in Ovid, Met. ii. 409, <i>Alcmenia</i>, Alcmene, mother
  of Hercules; see Ovid, Met. ix. 281; cf. Troil. iii. 1428; T. G. 123.</p>

  <p>823. <i>Europa</i>, the story is in Ovid, Met. ii. 858. See Legend of
  Good Women, 113, and the note; T. G. 118.</p>

  <p>824. <i>Dane</i>, Danae, mother of Perseus; see Ovid, Met. iv. 610. In
  Chaucer, C. T., A 2062, <i>Dane</i> means Daphne. <i>Antiopa</i>, mother
  of Amphion and Zethus; it may be noted that Jupiter's intrigues with
  Europa, Antiopa, Alcmene, and Danae, are all mentioned together in Ovid,
  Met. vi. 103-13. It follows that our author had read Ovid.</p>

  <p>831. '<i>There is no lak, saue</i> onli of pitè'; T. G. 749.</p>

  <p>841. The word <i>the</i> was probably written like <i>ye</i>, giving,
  apparently, the reading <i>ye ye</i>; then one of these was dropped. The
  long passage in ll. 841-903 may be compared with the pleadings of the
  lover in La Belle Dame sans Merci (p. 307, above); with T. G. 970-1039;
  and with the Kingis Quair, st. 99. Note the expression 'of beaute rote,'
  T. G. 972; and '<i>Princes</i> of youthe,' T. G. 970 (two lines above);
  see l. 843.</p>

  <p>849. <i>persant</i>, piercing; common in Lydgate; T. G. 328, 756,
  1341; Black Knight, 28, 358, 591, 613. Cf. 'And <i>with</i> the
  <i>stremes of your percyng</i> light'; Kingis Quair, 103.</p>

  <p>852-3. Cf. T. G. 1038-9; Kingis Quair, st. 103, l. 7.</p>

  <p>858. 'Of verrey routhe upon my peynes rewe'; T. G. 1001.</p>

  <p>865. 'To love him best ne shal I <i>never repente</i>'; The Compleynt
  of Venus, 56, 64, 72. See note to l. 875. <!-- Page 549 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page549"></a>[549]</span></p>

  <p>872-3. Referring to Ch. Troilus, and Legend of Good Women, 580. 'To
  ben as trewe as was Antonyus To Cleopatre'; T. G. 778.</p>

  <p>874. <i>thinkes</i>; observe this Northern form.</p>

  <p>875. 'And therfore, certes, <i>to myn ending-day</i>'; The Compleynt
  of Venus, 55. See note to l. 865.</p>

  <p>882. <i>expert</i>, experienced; 'expert in love,' Troil. ii.
  1367.</p>

  <p>891. 'With al my hert I thanke yow <i>of youre profre</i>'; T. G.
  1060.</p>

  <p>897. Read <i>I</i>; this the scribe must have mistaken for the
  contraction for 'and.'</p>

  <p>901. 'And I beseech you not to be disdainful.'</p>

  <p>902. <i>seen my wil</i>, to see what I wish; but surely <i>wil</i> is
  an error for <i>bill</i>, petition; see l. 916. Then <i>rede</i> means
  'read it.'</p>

  <p>906. <i>com of</i>, be quick; see Troil. ii. 1738, 1742, 1750; and the
  numerous examples in Schick's note to T. G. 1272.</p>

  <p>911. Stowe, like the MS., ends the line with <i>why</i>. Bell supplied
  <i>makes thou straunge</i>.</p>

  <p>913. <i>Cambrige</i>; this form is not found till after 1400. Chaucer
  has <i>Cant-e-brigg-e</i> (C. T., A 3921) in four syllables, which
  appears as <i>Cambrugge</i> in the late Lansdowne MS., after 1420. See
  Skeat, A Student's Pastime, pp. 397-8.</p>

  <p>922. <i>and have</i>, i.e. and have loved. On this construction, see
  Schick's note to T. G. 1275.</p>

  <p>925-7. <i>I ... doon</i>; more false grammar; equivalent to Lat.
  <i>ego faciamus</i>.</p>

  <p>929. 'And, whan I trespace, goodli <i>me correcte</i>'; T. G.
  1018.</p>

  <p>931-52. Compare the answers of the lady in La Belle Dame sans Merci
  (p. 309, &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>988-9. Cf. Parl. Foules, 90-1; Compl. to his Lady, 47-9.</p>

  <p>998. <i>dwale</i>, an opiate, a sleeping-draught; made from the
  <i>dwale</i> or 'deadly nightshade' (<i>Atropa belladonna</i>). It occurs
  once in Chaucer; C. T., A 4161. See my note to P. Plowman, C. xxiii.
  379.</p>

  <p>1000. <i>y-wis afrayed</i>, (being) certainly frightened. The use of
  <i>y-wis</i> in such a position is most unusual.</p>

  <p>1016-7. 'Right as the fressh[e] rodi rose nwe Of hir coloure to wexin
  she bigan'; T. G. 1042-3.</p>

  <p>1023. Something is lost here. There is no gap in the MS.; but there
  was probably one in the MS. from which it was copied. I think six stanzas
  are lost; see the Introduction.</p>

  <p>1032-3. 'And their fellow-furtherer,' i.e. fellow-helper.</p>

  <p>1034. <i>Dred</i> is one of the personifications from the Roman de la
  Rose; see Rom. Rose, 3958; so in T. G. 631.</p>

  <p>1040. 'Gall under honey'; see l. 542 above. Cf. T. G. 192.</p>

  <p>1042. 'Lay aside your confidence (courage), for all her white
  (flattering) words'; cf. Troil. iii. 901.</p>

  <p>1045. <i>thow wot</i>, false grammar for <i>thou wost</i>.</p>

  <p>1049. <i>The ton</i> = <i>thet on</i>, the one; <i>the toder</i> =
  <i>thet oder</i>, the other. <!-- Page 550 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page550"></a>[550]</span><i>Oder</i> is a remarkable form; see
  Halliwell. So also <i>brodur</i>, in Le Bon Florence of Rome, ed. Ritson,
  931.</p>

  <p>1053-4. 'Hir kind is fret with doublenesse'; XIII. 80 (p. 293).</p>

  <p>1055. 'So I cast about to get rid of Despair's company'; hence
  <i>taken</i>, in l. 1056, is in the infin. mood.</p>

  <p>1058. <i>bay-window</i>; cf. Assembly of Ladies, 163. The earliest
  known quotation for <i>bay-window</i> is dated 1428, in a prosaic
  document.</p>

  <p>1060. 'As any ravenes <i>fether</i> it shoon <i>for-blak</i>'; spoken
  of hair; C. T., A 2144.</p>

  <p>1065. 'Ther needeth non <i>auctoritee allegge</i>'; C. T., A 3000.</p>

  <p>1072. Cf. Troil. ii. 855-61.</p>

  <p>1083. <i>were</i>, wear; altered by Bell to <i>ware</i>, which is a
  form of the past tense.</p>

  <p>1087. <i>she</i> seems to be spoken casually of some woman in the
  company; and <i>prety man</i>, in l. 1088, is used in a similar way.</p>

  <p><i>goth on patens</i>, walks in pattens. A very early example of the
  word <i>paten</i>. It occurs in Palsgrave (1530). <i>fete</i>, neat,
  smart; used by Lydgate; see <i>Feat</i> in the New E. Dict.</p>

  <p>1095. Here the author comes back again to the Temple of Glas, 143-246,
  which see; and cf. The Kingis Quair, stanzas 79-93.</p>

  <p>1096. <i>black</i>, Dominican friars; <i>white</i>, Carmelites;
  <i>gray</i>, Franciscans.</p>

  <p>1100. From T. G. 196-206; for the nuns, see T. G. 207-8.</p>

  <p>1104. '<i>In wide</i> copis <i>perfeccion to feine</i>'; T. G. 204.
  See l. 1116.</p>

  <p>1106. 'That <i>on hir freendis al the</i> wite they leide'; T. G.
  208.</p>

  <p>1116. '<i>In wide copis</i> perfeccion to feine'; T. G. 204.</p>

  <p>1134. '<i>Ther thou were weel</i>, fro thennes artow weyved'; C. T., B
  308.</p>

  <p>1136. Cf. 'With sobbing teris, and with ful pitous soune'; T. G.
  197.</p>

  <p>1139. Cf. 'And other eke, that for <i>pouertè</i>'; T. G. 159.</p>

  <p>1150. <i>prang</i>, pang (MS. <i>prange</i>; and so in Stowe); altered
  to <i>pang</i> by Bell and Morris. '<i>Pronge</i>, Erumpna' [aerumna];
  Prompt. Parv. '<i>Throwe</i> [throe], <i>womannys pronge</i>, Erumpna';
  the same. '<i>Prange</i>, oppression, or constraint'; Hexham's Dutch
  Dict. Cf. Gothic: 'in allamma <i>ana-pragganai</i>,' we were troubled on
  every side, 2 Cor. vii. 5; where <i>gg</i> is written for <i>ng</i>, as
  in Greek. The mod. E. <i>pang</i> seems to have been made out of it,
  perhaps by confusion with <i>pank</i>, to pant.</p>

  <p>1160, 1164. 'And pitousli <i>on god and kynde pleyne</i>'; T. G. 224.
  But the context requires the reading <i>god of kind</i>, i.e. God of
  nature. In l. 1166, <i>leften</i> must be meant for a pp.; if so, it is
  erroneously formed, just like <i>kepten</i> above; see note to l.
  526.</p>

  <p>1173. <i>werdes</i>, Fates; obviously the right reading; yet the MS.,
  Stowe, and Morris have <i>wordes</i>, and Bell alters the line. The
  confusion between <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> at this time is endless. See
  <i>Werdes</i>, <i>Wierdes</i> in the Gloss. to Chaucer.</p>

  <p>1177. <i>he</i>, another of the company; cf. <i>she</i> in l. 1087.
  Both Morris and Bell alter the text. Bell reminds us that the character
  here <!-- Page 551 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page551"></a>[551]</span>described is that of Shakespeare's
  Benedict. But it is obviously copied from Troilus! see Troil. i.
  904-38.</p>

  <p>1189. The word <i>post</i> is from Troil. i. 1000: 'That thou shalt be
  the beste <i>post</i>, I leve, Of al his lay.'</p>

  <p>1198. <i>Shamefastness</i>, Bashfulness; borrowed from <i>Honte</i> in
  the Rom. de la Rose, 2821; called <i>Shame</i> in the E. version, 3034.
  Hence the reference to <i>roses</i> in l. 1203, though it comes in
  naturally enough.</p>

  <p>1211. <i>were not she</i>, if it had not been for her.</p>

  <p>1213. <i>returnith</i>, turns them back again; used transitively.</p>

  <p>1218. 'When Bashfulness is dead, Despair will be heir' (will succeed
  in her place). Too bold lovers would be dismissed.</p>

  <p>1219. <i>Avaunter</i>, Boaster; as in Troil. iii. 308-14. The line
  sounds like an echo of 'Have at thee, Jason! now thyn horn is blowe!'
  Legend of Good Women, 1383.</p>

  <p>1222. <i>wowe</i>, woo; evidently the right reading; so in Morris. Cf.
  The Letter of Cupid, V. 274-80 (p. 226).</p>

  <p>1238. <i>statut</i>, i.e. the sixteenth statute (l. 435).</p>

  <p>1242. '<i>Avauntour</i> and <i>a lyere</i>, al is on'; Troil. iii.
  309.</p>

  <p>1253. <i>sojoure</i>, sojourn, dwell, used quite wrongly; for O.F.
  <i>sojur</i> (originally <i>sojorn</i>) is a sb. only, like mod. F.
  <i>séjour</i>. The O.F. verb was <i>sojorner</i>, <i>sojourner</i>,
  whence M.E. <i>sojornen</i>, <i>sojournen</i>, correctly used by Chaucer.
  The sb. <i>sojour</i> occurs in Rom. Rose, 4282, 5150. The mistake is so
  bad that even the scribe has here written <i>soiorne</i>; but, unluckily,
  this destroys the rime.</p>

  <p>1255. 'Envy is admirably represented as rocking himself to and fro
  with vexation, as he sits, dark, in a corner.'&mdash;Bell. For all this,
  I suspect the right word is <i>rouketh</i>, i.e. cowers, as in C. T., A
  1308. <i>Rokken</i> is properly transitive, as in C. T., A 4157.</p>

  <p>1257. For the description of Envy, see Rom. Rose, 247. But the author
  (in l. 1259) refers us to Ovid, Met. ii. 775-82, q. v.</p>

  <p>1259. <i>Methamorphosose</i>; this terrible word is meant for
  <i>Metamorphoseos</i>, the form used by Chaucer, C. T., B 93. But the
  true ending is <i><span class="nw">-e&#x14D;n</span></i>, gen. pl. The
  scribe has altered the suffix to <i><span class="nw">-ees</span></i>,
  thus carelessly destroying the rime.</p>

  <p>1268. <i>Prevy Thought</i> is taken from <i>Doux-Pensers</i> in the
  Rom. de la Rose, 2633, called <i>Swete-Thought</i> in the E. Version,
  2799; see the passage.</p>

  <p>1288. Cf. 'Hir person he shal afore him sette'; R. R. 2808.</p>

  <p>1290. Cf. 'This comfort wol I that thou take'; R. R. 2821.</p>

  <p>1295. Cf. 'Awey his anger for to dryve'; R. R. 2800.</p>

  <p>1315. Schick refers us, for this fiction, to the Rom. Rose, 939-82,
  where Cupid has two sets of arrows, one set of <i>gold</i>, and the other
  set <i>black</i>. Gower, Conf. Amantis (ed. Pauli, i. 336), says that
  Cupid shot Ph&oelig;bus with a dart of <i>gold</i>, but Daphne with a
  dart of <i>lead</i>. In the Kingis Quair, stanzas 94-5, Cupid has
  <i>three</i> arrows, one of <i>gold</i>, one of <i>silver</i>, and one of
  <i>steel</i>. But the fact is, that our author, like Gower, simply
  followed Ovid, Met. i. 470-1. Let Dryden explain it:&mdash; <!-- Page 552
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page552"></a>[552]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgsq">'One shaft is pointed with refulgent gold</p>
      <p>To bribe the love, and make the lover bold;</p>
      <p>One blunt, and tipped with lead, whose base allay</p>
      <p>Provokes disdain, and drives desire away.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>1317. There is here a gap in the story. The speaker is Rosial, and she
  is addressing Philogenet, expressing herself favourably.</p>

  <p>1319-20. <i>hight</i>, promised. <i>had</i>, would have.</p>

  <p>1324. <i>she</i>, i.e. Pity, as in l. 701.</p>

  <p>1328. MS. <i>tender reich</i>; Stowe, <i>tenderiche</i>; which must be
  wrong; read <i>tender reuth</i>. Confusion between <i>ch</i> and
  <i>th</i> is common. <i>where I found</i>, where I (formerly) found much
  lack.</p>

  <p>1332. For Pity's golden shrine, see l. 694.</p>

  <p>1353. This notion of making the birds sing matins and lauds is hinted
  at in the Cuckoo and Nightingale&mdash;'That they begonne of May <i>to
  don hir houres</i>'; l. 70. It is obviously varied from Chaucer's Parl.
  Foules, where all the birds sing a roundel before departing. Next, we
  find the idea expanded by Lydgate, in the poem called Devotions of the
  Fowls; Minor Poems, ed. Halliwell, p. 78; the singers are the popinjay,
  the pelican, the nightingale, the lark, and the dove. All these reappear
  here, except the pelican. A chorus of birds, including the mavis, merle,
  lark, and nightingale, is introduced at the close of Dunbar's Thistle and
  Rose. The present passage was probably suggested by Lydgate's poem, but
  is conceived in a lighter vein.</p>

  <p>The Latin quotations are easily followed by comparing them with The
  Prymer, or Lay Folks' Prayer-Book, ed. Littlehales (E. E. T. S.). They
  all appear in this 'common medieval Prayer-book'; and, in particular, in
  the Matins and Lauds of the Hours of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Matins
  end at l. 1407. The Matins contain:&mdash;the opening, the <i>Venite</i>,
  a Hymn, three Psalms, an Antiphon, Versicles and Responses, three Lessons
  (each with Versicles and Responses), and the <i>Te Deum</i>. The Lauds
  contain:&mdash;the opening, eight Psalms (the <i>Benedicite</i>
  considered as one), Antiphon, Chapter, Hymn, the <i>Benedictus</i>;
  &amp;c. I point out the correspondences below.</p>

  <p>1354. Observe that the nightingale sings <i>in a hawthorn</i> in the
  Cuckoo and Nightingale, 287 (p. 358).</p>

  <p>1356. <i>Domine, labia mea aperies</i>, Lord, open thou my lips; 'the
  opening' of Matins.</p>

  <p>1358. <i>bewrye</i>, a variant of <i>bewreye</i>, to bewray; used by
  Dunbar.</p>

  <p>1359. <i>Venite, exultemus</i>, Ps. xcv (Vulgate, xciv); still in
  use.</p>

  <p>1362. 'The unhappy chorister who comes late skulks in behind the desks
  and stalls.'&mdash;Bell.</p>

  <p>1364. <i>Domine, Dominus noster</i>, Ps. viii. The 'first psalm.'</p>

  <p>1366. <i>Celi enarrant</i>, Ps. xix (Vulgate, xviii). The 'second
  psalm.'</p>

  <p>1370. <i>Domini est terra</i>, Ps. xxiv (Vulgate, xxiii). The 'third
  psalm.' <i>this Laten intent</i>, this Latin signifies; <i>intent</i> is
  the contracted form of <i>intendeth</i>; by analogy with <i>went</i> for
  <i>wendeth</i>. <!-- Page 553 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page553"></a>[553]</span></p>

  <p>1372. A queer reminiscence of Troil. iii. 690:&mdash;'There was no
  more to <i>skippen nor to</i> traunce.'</p>

  <p>1373. <i>Jube, Domine, benedicere</i>, 'Lord, comaunde us to blesse';
  versicle preceding the first lesson; which explains l. 1374.</p>

  <p>1375. Cf. 'Legende of Martres'; Letter of Cupid, 316 (p. 227); and the
  note.</p>

  <p>1380. Here follows the second lesson. The <i>lectorn</i> is the mod.
  E. lectern, which supports the book from which the lessons are read.</p>

  <p>1384. 'The glad month of us who sing.' Cf. 'lepten <i>on the
  spray</i>'; Cuckoo and Nightingale, 77 (p. 350).</p>

  <p>1387. Here follows the third lesson, read by the dove.</p>

  <p>1390. This looks like an allusion to the endless joke upon cuckolds,
  who are said, in our dramatists, to 'wear the horn'; which the offender
  is said 'to give.' If so, it is surely a very early allusion. Here
  <i>give an horn</i> = to scorn, mock.</p>

  <p>1400. <i>Tu autem, domine, miserere nobis</i>, 'thou, lord, have merci
  of us,' said at the conclusion of each lesson; to which all responded
  <i>Deo gratias</i>, 'thanke we god!' See The Prymer, p. 5.</p>

  <p>1401. <i>Te deum amoris</i>; substituted for <i>Te deum laudamus</i>,
  which is still in use; which concludes the matins.</p>

  <p>1402. <i>Tuball</i>, who was supposed to have been 'the first
  musician.' As to this error, see note in vol. i. p. 492 (l. 1162).</p>

  <p>1408. <i>Dominus regnavit</i>, Ps. xciii (Vulgate, xcii); the 'first
  psalm' at Lauds.</p>

  <p>1411. <i>Jubilate deo</i>, Ps. c (Vulgate, xcix); the 'second psalm.'
  The third and fourth psalms are not mentioned.</p>

  <p>1413. <i>Benedicite, omnia opera</i>; still in use in our morning
  service; counted as the 'fifth psalm.'</p>

  <p>1415. <i>Laudate dominum</i>, Ps. cxlviii; the 'sixth psalm.' The
  seventh and eighth are passed over.</p>

  <p>1416. <i>O admirabile</i>; the anthem. The E. version is:&mdash;'O
  thou wonderful chaunge! the makere of mankynde, takynge a bodi with a
  soule of a maide vouchide sauf be bore [<i>born</i>]; and so,
  forth-goynge man, with-outen seed, yaf to us his godhede'; Prymer, p. 12.
  The 'chapter' and hymn are omitted.</p>

  <p>1422. <i>Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel</i>; still in use in our
  morning service. This is the last extract from 'the hours.'</p>

  <p>1434. 'She gadereth floures, <i>party</i> whyte and rede To make a
  sotil <i>garland</i>'; C. T., A 1053.</p>

  <p>1436. This is exactly like 'the battle of the flowers,' as seen in
  Italy.</p>

  <p>1437. <i>the gold</i>, the marigold; see C. T., A 1929.</p>

  <p>1440. <i>trew-love</i>; a name for herb paris (<i>Paris
  quadrifolia</i>). But as the 'true-love' is described as being
  <i>plited</i>, i.e. folded, it must rather be supposed to mean a true
  lover's knot or love-knot, which was simply a bow of ribbon given as a
  token of affection, and frequently worn by the lover afterwards. The
  bestowal of this token nearly made an end of him. <!-- Page 554 --><span

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><a href="#piece25">XXV. VIRELAI.</a></p>

  <p>Not a true virelay, as the ending <i>-ing</i> does not reappear in the
  second stanza; for a correct example, see note to Anelida and Arcite, 256
  (vol. i. p. 536). But it is of the nature of a virelay, inasmuch as the
  rime <i><span class="nw">-ate</span></i>, which concludes the first
  stanza, reappears in the second; and similarly, the ending <i><span
  class="nw">-ure</span></i>, which concludes the second stanza, reappears
  in the third; and so on, with the rime-endings <i><span
  class="nw">-ain</span></i> and <i><span class="nw">-aunce</span></i>.
  Compare the poem by Lord Rivers, in the same metre, alluded to in vol. i.
  p. 42.</p>

  <p>11. <i>ure</i>, destiny; as above, sect. XXIV. 634 (and note, p.
  546).</p>

  <p>20. The pronunciation of <i>ende</i> as <i>ind</i> is not uncommon in
  East Anglia, and may have been intended.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> In this connection, we must not
  forget the curious story told in Francis Thynne's <i>Animadversions</i>
  on Speght's edition of 1598, to the effect that his father (William
  Thynne) had some thoughts of inserting in the volume a piece called
  <i>The Pilgrim's Tale</i>, but was advised by the king to let it alone;
  and this, <i>not</i> on the ground that the Tale was written after 1536,
  and contained an allusion to <i>Perkin Warbeck</i>, but solely in
  deference to the king's remark&mdash;'William Thynne, I doubt this will
  not be allowed, for I suspect the bishops will call thee in question for
  it.' See F. Thynne, <i>Animadversions</i>, &amp;c., ed. Furnivall (Ch.
  Soc.), pp. 9, 89.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> These names are given, in the
  margin, in MS. Addit. 34360 only.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> Morris printed <i>sleepe</i>,
  giving no sense; MS. 10303 has <i>slepye</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> The way in which the spelling was
  gradually altered can be seen even from the following example, in which
  the eighth line of the Plowman's Tale is represented:&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> So in Thynne. But 'tyme' really
  concludes a sentence; and 'there' should have a capital letter.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> He had been imprisoned in 1384
  (p. <a href="#page33">33</a>, l. 101); but at p. <a
  href="#page49">49</a>, l. 126, he is leisurely planning a <i>future</i>
  treatise! At p. <a href="#page60">60</a>, l. 104, he is in prison
  <i>again</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_7" href="#NtA_7">[7]</a> See p. <a

  martyr'; p. <a href="#page34">34</a>, l. 115.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> Perhaps this is why Langland
  refers to 'the castel of Corf'; P. Plowman, C. iv. 140.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> Professor Morley
  says:&mdash;'As Boethius ... wrote three books of the Consolation of
  Philosophy," &amp;c. But Boethius wrote <i>five</i> books.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> One line is enough to shew the
  order of the texts; see p. <a href="#pagexv">xv</a>, footnote.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> But this proves nothing, as
  Urry departs from all sound texts in an erratic manner all his own.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> The expression 'the quenes
  heed,' at l. 158, hardly implies that there was then a queen of England.
  If it does, it makes the poem later than October, 1396.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> The line, as it stands, is
  ambiguous; what Spenser meant to say was&mdash;'the Ploughman that the
  Pilgrim playde awhyle'; which expresses the fact. The subject is 'the
  Ploughman'; and 'that' means 'whom.'</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> Mr. Wright says 1401, and
  refers to Capgrave's Chronicle. But this is surely an error; see J. H.
  Wylie's Hist. of Henry IV, i. 277-8; with a reference to the Close Rolls,
  3 Hen. IV, 2. 16.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_16" href="#NtA_16">[16]</a> Fairfax deduced the date from
  the poem here printed, l. 393.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> Shirley also refers to
  Lydgate's Temple of Glas; see Schick's edition of that poem; p.
  lxxxii.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_18" href="#NtA_18">[18]</a> Which is not the case; the
  text in the Trinity MS. is in the correct order.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> There is <i>no</i> copy in MS.
  Harl. 7333, as said by error in vol. i. p. 39.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21" href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> There is no authority, except
  Thynne, for the title The Cuckoo and the Nightingale. It has been
  repeated in all the printed editions, but does not appear in any MS.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> 'In Hereford and the far West,
  not Oldcastle alone, but the Actons, Cheynes, Clanvowes, Greindors, and
  many great gentlemen of birth, had begun to mell of Lollardy and drink
  the gall of heresy.'&mdash;Wylie, Hist. of Henry IV, vol. iii. p. 296.
  Sir T. Clanvowe was alive in 1404 (Test. Vetusta).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_23" href="#NtA_23">[23]</a> The MSS. have <i>ran</i> in C.

  with <i>began</i> in the same, 563.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_24" href="#NtA_24">[24]</a> Perhaps, more strictly, a
  dedication, the true envoy consisting of the last six lines only. But it
  is no great matter.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_25" href="#NtA_25">[25]</a> Hence F. 148, 'As gret-e
  perl-es, round and orient,' reappears in A. 528 without the final
  <i><span class="nw">-e</span></i>, in the form: 'With gret' perlés,
  <i>ful</i> fyne and orient.'</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> The examples of <i>trewly</i>
  in Book Duch. 1111, 1151, are doubtful. It is a slippery poem to scan.

  <p><a name="Nt_34" href="#NtA_34">[34]</a> No. 61 is The Storie of
  Thebes, which he of course knew to be Lydgate's; he adds it <i>after</i>
  the note&mdash;'Thus endeth the workes of Geffray Chaucer.'</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_35" href="#NtA_35">[35]</a> At the same time he struck out
  no. 56 (p. 34), as being by Lydgate.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_36" href="#NtA_36">[36]</a> In Moxon's Chaucer, which
  professed to accept Tyrwhitt's canon, this piece was omitted; but it was
  revived once more by Bell.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_37" href="#NtA_37">[37]</a> See The Athenæum, Nov. 4,
  1876; The Academy, June 3, 1878; Aug. 3, 1878.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_38" href="#NtA_38">[38]</a> My remark upon the Trinity MS.
  in vol. i. p. 56, that 'most of the pieces are in a handwriting of a
  later date [than 1463], not far from 1500,' does not apply to The Court
  of Love. This poem, together with two poems by Lydgate, fills part of a
  quire of twenty-four leaves <i>near the end</i> of the MS., of which the
  seventeenth has been cut out and the last three are blank; and this quire
  is quite distinct from the rest as regards the date of the writing, which
  is considerably later than 1500, and exhibits a marked change. There are
  two <i>lacunæ</i> in the poem, one after l. 1022, and another after l.
  1316; probably six stanzas are lost in each case, owing to the loss of
  the two corresponding leaves in the original from which the existing copy
  was made.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_39" href="#NtA_39">[39]</a> I doubt if speculation as to
  the possible meaning of these names will really help us.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_40" href="#NtA_40">[40]</a> Which looks as if the author
  had written <i>grewen</i> for <i>greven</i>, like a Scotchman.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_41" href="#NtA_41">[41]</a> A very bad mistake occurs in
  l. 1045, viz. <i>thou wot</i> instead of <i>thou wost</i>, as if one
  should say in Latin <i>tu scio</i>. It rimes with <i>dote</i>, which, in
  Chaucer, is dissyllabic.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_42" href="#NtA_42">[42]</a> There are many more;
  <i>fon-ne</i> becomes <i>fon</i>, to rime with <i>on</i>, 458;
  <i>tell-e</i> is cut down to <i>tell</i>, 518; <i>behold-e</i>, to
  <i>behold</i>, 652; <i>accord-e</i>, to <i>accord</i>, 746; &amp;c. The
  reader can find out more for himself; see ll. 771, 844, 862, 896, 1032,
  1334, 1389, &amp;c. In ll. 1063-4, we have <i>opinion</i> riming with
  <i>begon</i>, the Chaucerian forms being <i>opinioun</i> and
  <i>bigonne</i> or <i>bigunne</i>!</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_44" href="#NtA_44">[44]</a> The MS. has:&mdash;'Than is is
  lande'&mdash;by mistake.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_45" href="#NtA_45">[45]</a> It is clear that The Plowmans
  Tale and Jack Upland were inserted by Thynne and Speght respectively on
  religious grounds.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_46" href="#NtA_46">[46]</a> We may safely assign to
  Lydgate the pieces numbered XXII and XXIII, as well as those numbered
  VIII to XV.</p>
